# Introduction [intro]
In English, subjects of intransitive verbs all behave the same grammatically. In normal sentences they appear in preverbal position and, in the case of pronouns, in the nominative case. By contrast, objects of transitive sentences are postverbal and have oblique pronominal case. This is regardless of the fact that intransitive subjects may have a wide range of different relationships to their head verb. The degree of agentivity and affectedness of the subject varies considerably in the following examples, as does the dynamic or stative nature of the predicate itself:[^english-properties]

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \emph{voluntary activity}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I jump.
\item I go.
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{involuntary ``activity''}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I cough.
\item I vomit.
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{passive involvement}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I fall.
\item I die.
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{state}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I stand.
\item I sleep.
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{engl-prop} \emph{property (temporary or permanent)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I am tired.
\item I am tall.
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}

[^english-properties]: Copular constructions, as in (<!--\ref{engl-prop}-->), cannot really be considered instances of intransitive verbs in English. I include them here, since in many Arawak languages they are expressed via intransitive verbs and since those verbs will be the ones of particular interest.

This pattern is, of course, not unique to English, but found in most languages throughout the world. There are however languages where marking of intransitive "subjects" (the term "subject" itself being particularly problematic for such languages, as I will argue in section 2) is not at all uniform, but very much dependent on the relationship between the argument and the verb. Consider the examples from the following three languages:[^lakhota-unglossed]

[^lakhota-unglossed]: Unfortunately, the examples from Lakhota and Guaraní are not glossed in the source [#mithun91]; my attempts at doing so are tentative.

In Lakhota and Guaraní, two different sets of prefixes are used for the intransitive subject, depending on the verb; in Warekena, prefixes are used for one class of verbs and suffixes for another. The distinction between the two classes of verbs depends on the degree of active involvement of the participant with the action, although the exact boundaries differ from language to language. Such a pattern where intransitive subjects are not marked uniformly is called *split intransitivity*. Notice that the three languages are genetically unrelated, and while the latter two are part of the same linguistic macro-region (the Amazonian), Lakhota is wholly unconnected to them; even though this phenomenon is relatively rare, it is by no means restricted to certain geographic regions or language families.[^wals-cit]

[^wals-cit]: See the respective chapters in *The World Atlas of Language Structures* [#wals-comrie,wals-siewierska].

Warekena is part of the Arawak language family, which is spoken throughout the Amazon Basin and which, due to the complicated linguistic situation of the region, has a long history of contact with other language families, both within and outside the Amazon itself [for more details refer to section <!--\ref{arawak-general}--> or see e.g.\]\[][#aikhenvald02]. Most (but not all) Arawak languages exhibit the same split intransitive pattern. The aim of this thesis will be to investigate the phenomenon as it occurs in several languages from this family. First however, I shall give a more detailed introduction to the topic of grammatical relations, alignment systems and finally split intransitivity in chapter <!--\ref{theory}-->, all the while discussing the difficulties and limitations of all terms introduced. Then, in chapter <!--\ref{empirical}-->, I will conduct an exploratory survey of nine Arawak languages with regard to split intransitivity in order to uncover common patterns as well as individual differences.

[^other-terms]: Which is also known under several of other terms, including *split-S*, *active-stative*, *unaccusativity* and *semantic alignment* (see section <!--\ref{terminology}--> for a discussion of terminology).

A technical note is in order: Examples, tables and other language material are drawn from a variety of sources. Although I kept the orthography of the linguistic data mostly intact, I took some liberties with the glossing and translation in order to make the analysis more uniform or to highlight particularly important issues. Similarly, in some cases I didn't include the full example as given in the indicated source, but only the part relevant to the analysis.
