# Introduction
In this thesis I am going to investigate the grammatical phenomenon of *split intransitivity* as it manifests itself across various languages of the *Arawak family*.

Split intransitivity denotes a way of encoding the single argument to an intransitive verb such that it is sometimes marked as the "subject" of the transitive verb and sometimes as the "object", depending on the verbal semantics. This is best illustrated by comparing it to English (which uses what we call a *nominative-accusative* system):

As we can see blahblahblah.

In ch. 2?? I will lay out a more thorough foundation of split intransitivity. In ch. 3?? I will examine Arawak ...
