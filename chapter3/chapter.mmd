# A survey of Arawak languages

## The Arawak languages
Write loads of stuff about the situation in the Amazon, the Arawak languages etc. etc. This is all Aikhenvald, maybe some Campbell.

## Case studies

### The data
In order to get an overview over the phenomenon of split intransitivity in Arawak, I collected data from ?? languages, from sources such as grammars, articles and text collections. Of course, most Amazonian languages are poorly, if at all, documented; I couldn't, therefore, be particulary selective about the languages surveyed and had to consider what was readily available. No particular work has been dedicated to ensure the representativeness and balance of the sample, neither in terms of areal distribution, nor of linguistic subgroups within Arawak---which, as previously discussed, are a matter of debate anyway. This, as well as the relatively small size of the sample, and the limited reliability of the sources considered, indicate that the analyses carried out can be exploratory in nature at best, and that in order to get to more meaningful results, more work would have to devoted than is possible in this thesis.

I encountered several difficulties with the data, including the following:

- As confusing as the linguistic situation in the Amazon is, nomenclature does nothing to help. There are a lot of instances where the same name is used for quite unrelated languages, such as Baniwa ?? (ref?), or the two probably unrelated languages, one now extinct, that are called Warekena (see section ??)---problems that arise when either very general endonyms or exonyms are used, or when the cultural identity of a group is mistaken with its linguistic one; the converse problem, where multiple names are used to refer to the same language, arises with Garifuna (see section ??), and it seems unclear whether these really indicate the same language or maybe slightly different variants. More generally, we have to assume both historical and dialectal variation in languages, and as soon any language is being described by more than one source, there is no guarantee that the same variety is being considered after all.
- Arawak languages seem to be generally head-marking, but there is quite a deal of variation as to how obligatory cross-referencing affixes really are. Many languages allow particularly the ellipsis of third person affixes, which may complicate the analysis further.
- I touched on the issue of the defition of verbs briefly in the previous chapter (did I??). When we find (as we will below) that in Arawak languages, patientive intransitive verbs are really property "verbs", not only does this beg the question as to the definition of word classes, but it also means that sources can not be relied upon too much, especially when they mention adjectives as a word class as well. (On this I should elaborate more)
- Of course, the sources themselves are of varying quality; even assuming that the data they recorded is correct, not all of them provide glossed examples, translational equivalents may not be exact, allomorphy may pose analytical problems, they sometimes contradict themselves (Aikhenvald: Bare?) and they sometimes operate in frameworks such as tagmemics that are not easily accessible as of today.

6? of the languages considered I will describe in detail in the sections that follow. I chose languages that are as different from each other as possible, in terms of geography or contact situation, assuming that this would lead to the most variation in the domain of alignment systems as well. Warekena (??) illustrates split intransitivity similar as to how it is found in a lot of other Arawak languages. Tariana (??) is interesting, as it is one of the only Arawak languages with a case system, maybe owing to its long history of contact to Tucanoan languages. Garifuna (??) is the only Arawak language spoken outside South America and has had a very complex history of contact with a number of languages, including Carib and European languages. Amuesha (??) is spoken at the Southern borders of the Amazon region and clearly shows the influence of Andean languages, such as Quechua and Aymara. More?? The remaining ?? languages will be considered more summarily. Table ?? lists some key properties of each language surveyed and also includes the sources consulted.

### Warekena
According to [#aikhenvald98;], Warekena is a North Arawak language spoken along the Xie river, a tributary to the Upper Rio Negro, in Northern Brazil, near the border to Venezuela. Apparently, the Warekena people used to speak another language, called by Aikhenvald the "old" Warekena (and classified as part of the Içana-Vaupes subgroup), which is in part documented in earlier literature; later however, most of the Warekena people adopted a dialect of Baniwa of Guainia as the "new" Warekena, described here. Those two varieties are not mutually intelligible, which means that the literature, which does not generally distinguish between them, can be misleading. Warekena is currently in a state of acute endangerment, given that the language is only spoken by people over fifty and not used in everyday communication anymore.

In Warekena, as in many Arawak languages, A arguments are cross-referenced by prefixes, which incidentally are the same ones used to indicate possessors on nouns, and P arguments by suffixes on the verb.[^enclitics] The Warekena affixes are given in the following table[293][#aikhenvald98]:

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||
|     | A prefixes    | P suffixes  | A prefixes  | P suffixes  |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1   | nu-           | -na         | wa-         | -wi         |
| 2   | pi-           | -pi         | ni-         | -ni         |
| 3f  | yu-           | -yu         | ni-         | -ni         |
| 3nf | Ø/i-          | Ø           | ni-         | -ni         |
[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Warekena]

[^enclitics]: Warekena, according to Aikhenvald, uses prefixes and enclitics. The distinction between affixes and clitics, though, is not significant for the analysis in the present thesis.

As is readily apparent, the prefixes and suffixes are almost identical, save for the position with respect to the verbal head, something that is also common in Arawak languages. One could speculate as to the origin of this marking pattern: Maybe the affixes (or clitics) were once independent pronouns, and word order served to distinguish A from P; the grammaticalisation process that turned the pronouns into morphemes dependent on the verb would have to have occured before Proto-Arawak, since according to reconstructions it already showed the same marking patterns as Warekena (??). The question remains, in such a scenario, at what point in history exactly the split-intransitive pattern (described below) emerged: if this happened before the pronouns turned into affixes, it would mean a (historical) example of the rather rare type of split intransitivity in word order.

Since non-feminine third person singular is generally unmarked (except when in focus; in that case the *i-* prefix is used) and all third person P suffixes can be elided in the presence of full NPs, not all constructions make the agreement system and the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs readily apparent. A few examples of transitive sentences are given below:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[359]{aikhenvald98}
\gll yu-tawina-na nu-ʃuɺuami
     3sgf-grow-1sg 1sg-mother
\glt `My mother brought me up.'
\glend
\item \citet[360]{aikhenvald98}
\gll nu-bukuita-mia aʃi
     1sg-lit-PERF fire
\glt `I lit the fire.'
\glend
\item \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\gll yawa-na weni (epaɺu-bune kutʃa-na)
     fall-1sg rain (it-because wet-1sg)
\glt `Rain fell on me, (this is why I am wet).'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

In (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) we can see both an A prefix and a P suffix, but in the next two examples only one argument is marked: the P argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->b) and the A argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c) are third person non-feminine singular and therefore get zero marking.

Aikhenvald mentions that the unmarked word order is AVP, where Sa aligns with A and Sp with P; that is, word order is split intransitive as well. Examples such as (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) and (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c) seem to contradict this, but maybe these are cases of marked word order. In any way, without significantly more text samples, it is hard to tell how exactly word order behaves in terms of alignment.
