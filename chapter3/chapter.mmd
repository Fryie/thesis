# A survey of Arawak languages [empirical]
Having laid out a theoretical foundation for the study of split intransitivity in the previous chapter, I will in this chapter proceed to analyse the morphosyntactic alignment of nine languages of the Arawak family. I will briefly introduce this family in its regional, areal and historical context in section <!--\ref{arawak-general}--> and then devote section <!--\ref{studies}--> to the individual languages.

## The Arawak languages [arawak-general]
The Arawak language family is spoken in the Amazon Basin, one of the most poorly documented and least understood, and at the same time most diverse linguistic regions of the world [#introamazon99]. Due to extensive language contact and the complex history of migrations, genetic relationships and areal influence have become hard to tell apart. There are a number of established language families in the Amazon---such as Arawak, Tupí-Guaraní, Tucano and Carib---but they don't generally spread over contiguous regions; instead languages of one family may be found over the entire Amazon Basin, interdispersed with genetically unrelated languages.

Multilingualism is traditional in the Amazon region; some tribes used to wage wars against their neighbouring tribes and take the vanquished people as slaves; in other situations there appears to be a master-servant relationship (e.g. between the Tucano and the Makú tribes, the former of which have developed agriculture and the latter of which are hunter-gatherers), and in areas like the Vaupés linguistic exogamy is practiced (see section <!--\ref{tariana}--> or <!--\citealt{aikhenvald02}-->).

The advent of Europeans changed the cultural and linguistic situation considerably. Many tribes went extinct primarily because of the diseases imported by Europeans to which the native population had developed no resistance; others suffered heavy losses fighting the invaders. Some peoples gave up their homes and fled, often seeking refuge with other tribes. In many cases distinct linguistic communities are known to have merged, with people from several tribes now speaking one common language. In other situations, especially in more recent history, European influence led to the indigenous population becoming acculturated and losing their native language. Of about two to five million people living in the Amazon region in 1500, no more than 400,000 remain today; and of the 170 languages still spoken in Brazil, only four have more than 10,000 speakers. Most of those languages are likely to go extinct in the course of the next century.

[#aikhenvald12;] uses the term *language region* for the Amazon Basin. In a language region, languages tend to share certain characteristics, but unlike linguistic areas the exact contact patterns cannot be reconstructed and may have happened a long time ago or through intermediaries. There are a few traits common to most Amazonian languages [8--9][#introamazon99]; for the present thesis, the following seem the most relevant:

1. Most languages are head-marking with little fusion.
2. Most languages have prefixes, but fewer prefix than suffix positions.
3. Fully accusative alignment systems are rare; instances of ergative or split intransitive patterns are found throughout.

This is in contrast to languages of the Andean region which are generally fully accusative, somewhat more fusional with a mixed head- and dependent-marking system and have no prefixes. It stands to reason that these could have influenced marking patterns in some Arawak languages spoken near the Andes, such as Amuesha (see section <!--\ref{amuesha}-->).

Arawak (<!--\citealt{aikhenvald99}, \citeyear{aikhenvald12}:32-36-->) is a language family comprising about 40 living languages, the largest family of the region, spoken in 12 countries mostly in South America, but partially also in Central America, outside of the Amazonian. This family's genetic unity is undisputed, but the term *Arawak* (or *Arawakan*) is used by some linguists for a hypothetical macro-family including the established Arawak (called *Maipuran* by those linguists) and some other minor language families such as Arawá, Guamo and Chapacura. As has been argued [e.g.\]\[][#introamazon99,aikhenvald99,campbell97], those proposals lack the rigourous application of the comparative method and are therefore without solid foundation. Here, Arawak is used in the former uncontroversial sense. Internal classification of Arawak has also proven quite difficult, mainly due to the lack of reliable data for most languages, although some low-level subgroups have been established. [#aikhenvald99;] claims that North Arawak languages show some similarities not found elsewhere in Arawak, but argues that it is not yet possible to tell whether these are due to inheritance from a common ancestor or to language contact.

## Case studies [studies]
In this section, I am going to analyse morphosyntactic alignment properties of nine Arawak languages: Warekena, Kurripako, Baure, Tariana, Apurinã, Garifuna, Wapixana, Bare and Amuesha. Section <!--\ref{results}--> will contain a summary of the findings.

I employed the rigourous approach developed in section <!--\ref{rigour}--> in my analyses here. I first tried to identify the prototypical transitive clause (or MBC, in Lazard's terminology) in order to individuate the A and P primitives; then I looked for a split pattern in intransitive verbs where some verbs would mark their S argument like A and others like P, and then proceeded to identify the classes of verbs that would fall into each class. Given that Arawak languages are generally head-marking, I focused on the behaviour of verbal affixes. However, for Tariana (which is partially dependent-marking) I will also discuss case marking (see section <!--\ref{tariana}-->), and whenever I could find relevant information I also included a discussion of word order behaviour and in some cases even of alignment in other syntactic constructions, e.g. pivot constraints. While I focussed on verbs derived from verbal or adjectival roots, since they appeared to be more "typical," sometimes I have included a discussion of other types of constructions such as denominal verbs (with the markers *ka-* or *ma-*) in Apurinã (section <!--\ref{apurina}-->). The fact that I didn't include such discussion for all languages does not mean that the pattern is restricted to the specific languages, but only that I didn't find clear enough data for the other ones [in fact, the negative *ma-* prefix seems to be typical for Arawak in general, see\]\[186][#aikhenvald12]. Since data was sparser for some languages than for others, the discussion will necessarily not be of equal scope for all languages; however, except for Amuesha, where the situation is not completely clear given the material I had, for all of the languages I investigated, I was able to understand the general alignment pattern of the verbal marking system.

As for the selection of languages, notice that it does not constitute a representative sample. Languages were not chosen with respect to balance in terms of geographic distribution or subgrouping (which is often controversial anyway, as mentioned), but according to whether they appeared to be interesting case studies and whether I could access relevant and reliable source material about them. Since the size of the sample is too small anyway for any kind of inferential statistical analysis, this does not matter much; it just indicates that the scope of this survey is exploratory in nature.

The aim of providing an empirically adequate analysis of the languages in question, using the strict methodology outlined before, was made difficult by at least the following factors:

1. As confusing as the linguistic situation in the Amazon is, nomenclature does nothing to help (<!--\citealt{aikhenvald12}:21-23; \citealt{campbell97}:5-7 notes that this is a general problem within American Indian linguistics-->). There are a lot of instances where the same name is used for quite unrelated languages, such as Baniwa of Guainia and Baniwa of Içana, or the two only distantly related languages, one now extinct, that are called Warekena (see section <!--\ref{warekena}-->). These problems may arise when autonyms (self-designations) or exonyms (designation by others, such as other tribes or Europeans) with very general meanings are used, that may translate to something like "our language," or when the cultural identity of a group is mistaken with its linguistic one; the converse problem, where multiple names are used to refer to the same language, arises for example with Garifuna (see section <!--\ref{garifuna}-->). Sometimes it seems unclear whether different names indicate the same language or maybe slightly different variants, or really different languages. More generally, we have to assume both historical and dialectal variation in languages, and as soon as any language is being described by more than one source, there is no guarantee that the same variety is being considered after all. Also of note, although less problematic, is that due to different orthographic conventions in English, Spanish and Portuguese, language names may be spelt differently by different authors (such as *Warekena* or *Guarequena*, *Wapixana* or *Wapishana* and so on).
2. Arawak languages seem to be generally head-marking, but there is quite a deal of variation as to how obligatory cross-referencing affixes really are. Many languages allow particularly the ellipsis of third person affixes, which may complicate the analysis further. Even more, it is often unclear whether independent pronouns have to appear in certain situations or whether they were merely included conveniently by the linguist in order to make a point. Thus when e.g. [#baure-kurri;] claim that SP is marked by a postverbal pronoun in Kurripako, one may question whether this pronoun is really obligatory. On the other hand, the claim made by [#wapixana;] that Wapixana adjectives cannot have verbal marking cannot necessarily be verified since verbal markers can be dropped in general.
3. I touched on the issue of the definition of verbs briefly in the previous chapter. When we find that in Arawak languages, patientive intransitive verbs are generally descriptive verbs (i.e. they denote properties), not only does this beg the question as to the definition of word classes, but it also means that sources can not be relied upon too much, especially when they mention adjectives as a separate word class. [#tariana;], for example, claims that unlike most other Arawak languages, Tariana does have a class of adjectives with its own set of characteristics not shared with nouns or verbs; this did not affect the analysis significantly, however, since they behave verbally in predicative use. More problematic is the issue with Wapixana adjectives, as mentioned in the previous point.
4. Of course, the sources themselves are of varying quality; even assuming that the data they recorded is correct, not all of them provide glossed examples; translational equivalents may not be exact; they sometimes contradict themselves (for example, [#bare;] claims that Bare has no personal suffixes, yet I found one in example (<!--\ref{bare-wo}-->c)); and they sometimes operate in frameworks such as tagmemics that are basically impenetrable as of today. For these reasons, I could not use many of the available grammars or articles.
5. Split intransitivity is generally apparent only with descriptive verbs, but such verbs tend to be infrequent in texts. If the pattern was not implicitly or explicitly discussed by the author (or at least verbal marking or grammatical relations in general), it was often impossible to find examples.
6. I established in chapter <!--\ref{theory}--> that in order to investigate split intransitivity, one has to identify the Major Bi-Actant Construction, that is a construction used for prototypical transitive verbs such as *hit* or *kill*. This was not possible in all cases; for some languages, I had to rely on examples of other types of verbs instead, assuming that they would show the same kind of construction as the MBC.
7. The question of *pivots* is somewhat complex in head-marking languages. Generally, person marking on verbs is not simply dropped in constructions such as coordination. Therefore, pivot constraints are only manifest in clauses with two different third person arguments (of the same gender, if the language has gender). Needless to say, such examples are rare.

### Warekena [warekena]
Warekena [#aikhenvald98] is a North Arawak language spoken along the Xie river, a tributary to the Upper Rio Negro, in Northern Brazil, near the border to Venezuela. Apparently, the Warekena people used to speak another language, which Aikhenvald calls the "old" Warekena and which is in part documented in earlier literature; later however, most of the Warekena people adopted a dialect of Baniwa of Guainia which then became the "new" Warekena, described here. Those two varieties are not mutually intellegible, which means that the literature, which does not generally distinguish between them, can be misleading. 

In Warekena, A arguments are cross-referenced by prefixes, which incidentally are the same ones used to indicate possessors on nouns, and P arguments by suffixes on the verb.[^enclitics] This prefix/suffix opposition is quite typical for Arawak languages, as we will see. The Warekena affixes are given in table <!--\ref{ware-tbl}-->.[^impersonal]

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||
|     | A prefixes    | P suffixes  | A prefixes  | P suffixes  |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1   | nu-           | -na         | wa-         | -wi         |
| 2   | pi-           | -pi         | ni-         | -ni         |
| 3F  | yu-           | -yu         | ni-         | -ni         |

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Warekena [293][#aikhenvald98]][ware-tbl]

[^enclitics]: Warekena, according to Aikhenvald, uses prefixes and enclitics. The distinction between affixes and clitics is however not significant for the analysis in the present thesis.

[^impersonal]: I omit from this table (as well as from subsequent ones) the impersonal prefix; it is of no particular interest to the present discussion.

As is readily apparent, the prefixes and suffixes are almost identical, save for the position with respect to the verbal head.  As discussed before, in many languages the absence of overt third person affixes complicates the analysis of argument marking. In Warekena, non-feminine third person singular is generally unmarked (except when in focus; in that case the *i-* prefix is used) and all third person P suffixes can be elided in the presence of full NPs; thus not all constructions demonstrate the agreement system and the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs clearly. A few examples of transitive sentences are given below:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[359]{aikhenvald98}
\gll yu-tawina-na nu-ʃuɺuami
     3SG.F-grow-1SG 1SG-mother
\glt `My mother brought me up.'
\glend
\item \citet[360]{aikhenvald98}
\gll nu-bukuita-mia aʃi
     1SG-lit-PERF fire
\glt `I lit the fire.'
\glend
\item \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\gll mutʃita-na umeni
     bite-1SG snake
\glt `A snake bit me.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

In (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) we can see both an A prefix and a P suffix (since both feminine third person and first person are overtly marked), but in the next two examples only one argument is marked: the P argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->b) and the A argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c) are third person non-feminine singular and therefore get zero marking.

Warekena has a split intransitive alignment system: There is a class of SA verbs that always get prefix marking and a class of SP verbs that are always marked by suffixes.[^ware-o-p] As discussed in section <!--\ref{split}-->, split intransitive languages differ as to the semantic basis of the split. As in all such languages, verbs such as *go*, which are volitional and dynamic, are SA verbs. But the classification does not seem to be based on either agentivity or dynamicity, since *die*, which is non-agentive (and would be marked as SP e.g. in Lakhota), or *lie*, which indicates a state, are SA verbs. Consider:

[^ware-o-p]: Consistent with previous terminology, I employ the symbols P and SP, instead of Aikhenvald's O and SO.

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\gll tsume \textbf{nu-wiyua-hã} \textbf{nu-yuɺuta-wa} peya tsemana bitsewe-hẽ wa: \textbf{i-tapa-mia-hã} nuʃiwa awi-ni umeni
      almost 1SG-die-PAUS 1SG-lie-NONACC one week hammock+LOC-PAUS then 3SG.NF-go-PERF-PAUS 1SG+from pain-DEM:PR snake
\glt `I almost died, I was lying in a hammock for a week, then the pain of the snake went away from me.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

Similarly, Aikhenvald mentions verbs such as *fall*, *drown*, *cough* or *sleep* as examples for SA verbs. SP verbs, by contrast, generally denote properties (<!--\ref{ware-sp}-->a-b), although there are some idosyncratic exceptions (<!--\ref{ware-sp}-->c):

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware-sp} \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll kutʃa-na
     wet-1SG
\glt `I am wet.'
\glend
\item
\gll wa-hã anua-na
     then-PAUS ill-1SG
\glt `Then i was ill.'
\glend
\item
\gll aɺiwa-wi
     get.up.early-1PL
\glt `Good morning (Lit.: we got up early).'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Aikhenvald also points out that due to the fuzziness of word classes in Warekena, almost any nominal, pronominal or adjectival root can be used as an SP verb with an attributive reading. It therefore appears as if the classification in Warekena is based on the distinction between verbs indicating properties and other verbs, i.e. descriptive and non-descriptive verbs.

There is also a third class of verbs that Aikhenvald mentions: These take an oblique argument marked by the preposition *yue*, 'to, for'. This is a small class and furthermore any such verb can also be used as an SP verb, with a slight change in meaning:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[363]{aikhenvald98}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-yue mawaɺi
     1SG-for hungry
\glt `I am hungry (just now).'
\glend
\item
\gll mawaɺi-na
     hungry-1SG
\glt `I am hungry (permanently).'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

As mentioned in section <!--\ref{rigour}-->, I believe that these verbs should be analysed as non-canonical subjects rather than instances of split intransitivity, since they are marked obliquely and since there are only a few of them.

In the previous discussion I have described cross-referencing affixes on the verb, but as noted in section <!--\ref{construction}-->, alignment patterns can be apparent in other parts of grammar as well. Aikhenvald mentions that the unmarked word order in transitive clauses is AVP and that in the intransitive clause SA aligns with A and SP with P; that is, word order would be split intransitive as well. Examples such as (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) and (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c), which contain postverbal A arguments, seem to contradict this, but maybe these are cases of marked word order. In any way, without significantly more text samples, it is hard to tell how exactly word order behaves in terms of alignment.

Warekena has a mixed pivot: some constructions are sensitive to the S/A alignment, while others operate in terms of S and P. Equi-NP deletion in coordinated clauses is an example of the former:[^pivot-1-2]

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware-equi-1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[235]{aikhenvald98}
\gll enami eda waʃi paɺa-mia
     man perceive jaguar run-PERF
\glt `A man saw a jaguar and the jaguar ran.'
\glend
\item \citet[236]{aikhenvald98}
\gll enami eda-hã waʃi paɺa-mia enami 
     man perceive-PAUS jaguar run-PERF man
\glt `A man saw a jaguar and ran.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{ware-equi-2} \citet[236]{aikhenvald98}
\gll wa ma-kaɺe-mia-hã ema waʃi mutʃita-mia-hã
     then NEG-breath-PERF-PAUS tapir jaguar bite-PERF-PAUS
\glt `Then the tapir grew tired, and the jaguar bit him.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^pivot-1-2]: Notice that there are no pivot restrictions for first and second persons, since they are always obligatorily marked.

Example (<!--\ref{ware-equi-1}-->a) illustrates that the ellipsed S constituent in the second clause (the argument of the verb 'to run') is coreferential with the P argument of the first, while (<!--\ref{ware-equi-1}-->b) shows that the A argument cannot be ellipsed in the same way. In (<!--\ref{ware-equi-2}-->) we can see that SP behaves the same as SA in terms of pivot restrictions; thus there is no split intransitive pattern apparent in Equi-NP deletion.[^breathless]

However, in presence of the presentative conjunction *wa(-hã)*, Equi-NP deletion seems to operate with respect to an S/A pivot instead. In the following example, the third person non-feminine singular S argument from the first clause is maintained as an A argument throughout:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[237]{aikhenvald98}
\gll wa-hã ʃa wa neta-hã peya neyawa i-ʃumiawa wa: apiñaya-yu pane-waba
     then-PAUS go then ask-PAUS one woman 3SG.F-wife+FEM then bring-3SG.F house-DIR
\glt `Then he went, then he asked another woman to be his wife, then he brought her home.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^breathless]: It may not be readily apparent, but *ma-kaɺe*, 'breathless, tired from work/running', is listed as an SP verb (p. 362), and seems to be an example of a verb formed from a nominal root.

Other types of constructions that are sensitive to an S/A pivot include certain types of subordinate clauses, e.g. locative clauses:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[282]{aikhenvald98}
\gll kuɺimaɺu nupa-mia-wa waɺi yutsia ema
     turtle arrive-PERF-NONACC where kill tapir
\glt `Turtle arrived to where he killed the tapir.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

All in all, pivots in Warekena seem to be rather complex, but there seems to be no evidence that they exhibit an SA/SP split the way verbal affixes (and maybe word order) do.


### Kurripako
In Kurripako [#baure-kurri], another North Arawak language spoken around the borders of Venezuela, Columbia and Brazil, A arguments are marked as prefixes on the verb, while P arguments are expressed post-verbally via independent pronouns (or full noun phrases). The exception are third person P arguments for which suffixes still exist:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{kurri-trans} \citet[399]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-heema kalaka
     1SG-barbecue chicken
\glt `I barbecue the chicken.'
\glend
\item
\gll nu-heema srua
     1SG-barbecue 3SG.F
\glt `I barbecue it.'
\glend
\item
\gll nu-heema-no
     1SG-barbecue-3SG.F
\glt `I barbecue it.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

(<!--\ref{kurri-trans}-->) provides three transitive verb constructions describing the same situation, using a full noun phrase, an independent pronoun and a pronominal suffix respectively.

The full table of pronominal affixes is given in <!--\ref{kurri-tbl}-->; unfortunately <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> don't provide a similar table for the independent pronouns.

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||
|     | A prefixes    | P suffixes  | A prefixes  | P suffixes  |

| 2   | pi-           |             | i-          |             |
| 3M  | li-           | -ni         | na-         | -na         |

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Kurripako [398][#baure-kurri]][kurri-tbl]

Even though the prefix/suffix opposition is largely lost in Kurripako, the language still works in split intransitive terms the same as Warekena, as shown by the following examples:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[398]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-dia-ka-wa panti-liku
     1SG-return-PROG-INTR house-LOC
\glt `I am returning into the house.'
\glend
\item
\gll haamaa-ka hnua
     tired-PROG 1SG
\glt `I am tired.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Verbs such as 'return' are SA verbs in Kurripako, while a descriptive verb like 'be tired' is an SP verb, much as it was the case in Warekena; the only difference is that SP verbs are not marked by suffixes but via independent pronouns, according to <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}-->.[^kurri-3]

More precisely, one could state that in terms of verbal marking, only SA verbs are marked with prefixes, while SP verbs are affixless. But are the independent pronouns really obligatory with SP verbs, and do they have to appear in postverbal position? If both are the case then it seems as if word order is also a construction displaying split intransitivity, while the obligatory marking is maybe due to Kurripako needing to show each participant explicitly.

The example of Kurripako shows that while in many Arawak languages the split intransitive pattern is based on a prefix/suffix opposition, this opposition remains present even after the (partial) loss of suffixes. 

[^kurri-3]: Unfortunately, with the few examples provided it is not possible to decide, but it stands to reason that third person SP arguments could be marked via suffixes the same as the P argument in (<!--\ref{kurri-trans}-->c).

It has additionally to be noted about Kurripako that [20][#aikhenvald12;] considers it to be same language as Baniwa of Içana (or more precisely part of the same continuum of mutually intellegible dialects), which is described as a fluid-S language by [81][#dixon94;]. The descriptions however do not seem quite to match: According to Dixon, Baniwa of Içana uses a prefix vs. suffix system not unlike Warekena; additionally "die" is described as an example of an SP verb. It is hard to see how such a discrepancy came to be, especially since Dixon explicitly cites Aikhenvald as a source of personal communication.[^baniwa-taylor] Maybe the two languages are distinct after all or maybe the different authors chose to describe different varieties; maybe it is simply the quality of the data that is at fault. In any case, situations like this one illustrate the challenges associated with a comparative study of languages that are so poorly described as the Amazonian ones are.

[^baniwa-taylor]: I could, unfortunately, not get my hands on the other reference Dixon cites, a 1991 grammar written in Portuguese [see the reference in\]\[81][#dixon94].

### Baure
[#baure-kurri;] contrast Kurripako with Baure, a South Arawak language spoken in Bolivia near the border to Brazil. Superficially the two are quite distinct: Baure has retained the prefix/suffix opposition,[^baure-clitics] as can be seen in (<!--\ref{baure-trans}-->b). (<!--\ref{baure-trans}-->a) shows that the P suffix is dropped in the presence of an overt NP, while the A prefix is retained even with the use of the emphatic independent pronoun:

[^baure-clitics]: Although they are analysed as clitics by <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}-->.

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Baure [400][#baure-kurri]][baure-affix]

<!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> argue that the split intransitive pattern in Baure is quite distinct from the one in Kurripako. While the SA marking in (<!--\ref{baure-sa}-->) is consistent with Kurripako, the examples in (<!--\ref{baure-non-sp}-->) would be SP verbs in Kurripako, but are marked with prefixes in Baure:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-sa} \citet[400]{baure-kurri}
\gll vi=šim ač vi=kowyo-po ač vi=imok
     1PL=arrive and 1PL=bathe-PRFLX and 1PL=sleep
\glt `We arrive, we take a bath (bathe ourselves), and we sleep.'
\glend
\item\label{baure-non-sp}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[401]{baure-kurri}

\glend
\item \citet[402]{baure-kurri}
\gll ni=mane-wapa
     1SG=cold-COS
\glt `I am cold/I got cold.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

The argument goes that the split is not between stative and dynamic verbs, as they analyse Kurripako,[^kurripako-stative] but between verbal and nonverbal predicates. This is illustrated by the following examples of SP verbs:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-sp} \citet[402]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll monči-wo=ni
     child-COP=1SG
\glt `I was a child.'
\glend
\item
\gll mehewkon-wape=ro
     bad-COS=3SG.M
\glt `It is bad.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

This analysis is unconvincing. Distinctions between verbs and other word classes, especially adjectives, are not obvious in many languages if they exist at all, and, as mentioned before, [#aikhenvald98;] explicitly states that their boundaries are fuzzy in Warekena. Moreover, I fail to see a principled difference between 'cold', 'tired' and 'bad' and why the former two could be called examples of stative verbs and the latter an adjective, also since affixes that indicate copular constructions (*COP*) or change of state (*COS*), appear both on SA and SP verbs. In any case, <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> do not really explain what they mean by this distinction between verbal and non-verbal predicates. It is therefore hard to understand what the split in argument marking really consists of. It may be that the split intransitive pattern in Baure is retreating and that the prefix marking is being generalised, such that more and more former SP verbs are used as SA verbs, but without more examples it is hard to tell; the split in Baure appears therefore to be more idiosyncratic in nature, with only a part of descriptive verbs being marked by suffixes. 

[^kurripako-stative]: Although I already argued that it's doubtful lexical aspect really is the semantic basis of the split in Arawak languages.

### Tariana [tariana]
Tariana [#tariana] is a North Arawak language spoken in the Vaupés river basin in northwestern Brazil. Linguistic communities in the Vaupés area, which include Tariana and East Tucano (that is, non-Arawak) languages, are in close contact and practice linguistic exogamy---that is, one can only marry people who speak a different language from one's own. Since language is very strongly associated with linguistic identity, the mixing of lexical material from several languages is generally frowned upon; however, Tariana has acquired some grammatical patterns not found in other Arawak languages due to Tucano influence. Most important for the present thesis is the development of a dependent-marking profile alongside the inherited head-marking one; that is, Tariana is one of the very few Arawak languages with core case marking. This of course means that a discussion of split intransitivity will have to consider case marking in addition to verbal cross-referencing (and word order).

The situation with respect to verbal marking is easier to assess. Arawak suffixes are lost in Tariana and only the prefixes remain, similar to Kurripako. A arguments are cross-referenced by prefixes, while P arguments are not marked at all on the verb, as shown by the transitive verb *-inu*, 'kill':

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[235]{tariana}
\gll di-na na-inu-kasu-pidana nha iɾi-ne
     3SG.NF-OBJ 3PL-kill-INT-REM.P.REP they blood-PL
\glt `The ``Irine'' (i.e. the Tariana, lit. people of the blood) were going to kill him.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

The full listing of personal prefixes is given in table <!--\ref{tariana-affix}-->.

[Cross-referencing verbal A prefixes in Tariana [122][#tariana]][tariana-affix]

The split in verbal cross-referencing is evident in that some intransitive verbs take personal prefixes whereas others don't. Since the S argument is sometimes marked the same as A (with a prefix) and sometimes the same as P (i.e., not at all), this satisfies our definition of split intransitivity. The following examples illustrate that:

<!--

As for Warekena, Aikhenvald distinguishes an Sio class of verbs (<!--\ref{tariana-sp}-->b) from the SP class ("SO" in her terminology); however, as far as verbal marking is concerned, there is no distinction: both simply don't mark their argument. The distinction will become relevant with case marking, as I will discuss shortly.

Since Aikhenvald does not treat the semantic basis of the split in particular depth and given the availability of textual data in [#tariana-texts,tariana;], I decided to investigate which verbs were marked as SA and which were marked as SP, concentrating only on verbal cross-referencing. I found that SP verbs were much (on one or two orders of magnitude) rarer than SA verbs. However, it is also possible that I missed some interesting examples; since SP verbs have no personal affixes it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them from other parts of speech, in particular since tense-evidentiality markers are enclitics that may attach to any part of speech [288][#tariana], as the remote past inferred marker *-pidana* in the following example:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[89]{tariana-texts}
\gll inipuku-se-pidana na kaini nheta

[Some SP verbs in Tariana texts]

One can immediately see the wide range of verbs that belong to the SA class. It's especially apparent here that the split does not operate in terms of agency or dynamicity (with non-agentive verbs such as 'die' or stative verbs such as 'stay' being SA verbs). Unfortunately, there are not many examples of SP verbs (SA verbs are much more common and I only showed a few selected ones here). Most of them are descriptive verbs, but some do not seem to fit the pattern, such as 'appear' or 'emit sound,' which might be idiosyncratic exceptions. I think however that this is different in the case of 'split'. To avoid confusion, it first has to be noted that the Arawak verb in question translates to the intransitive use of the verb 'split' (as in something splitting after being cut in half), not the transitive one. [239][#tariana;] mentions some similar examples as SP verbs, such as the near-synonym *ke:ka*, 'split open' or *lama*, 'burn, get burnt,' as in the following example:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[239]{tariana}
\gll lama-sina diha-dapana
     burn-REP.NONVIS ART-CL:HAB
\glt `This house was burning.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

Of course, this is still a small number of verbs that could just be behaving idiosyncratically. However, the verbs have in common that their S argument is very strongly affected by the action, a property generally associated with patients. Even if in Tariana (as generally in Arawak), agentivity is not the key factor in deciding whether a verb is SA or SP, it might be that in cases where the argument is particularly affected there is a tendency to treat it as an SP argument. Of course, there is at least one strong counterexample (the verb *yãmi*, 'die'), and it is not clear how many (if any) verbs behave similarly; and if this is indeed a pattern in Tariana, it's hard to tell whether this is an innovation of this particular language (maybe a reanalysis of split intransitivity in progress) or whether similar patterns can be found in other Arawak languages as well. Another argument in favour of the hypothesis that agentivity may play some (minor) role in Tariana's split intransitive system, is the SA verb *anihta*, 'aware':

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[77]{tariana-texts}
\gll diha di-anihta-tha-pidana
     he 3SG.NF-aware-FR-REM.P.INFR
\glt `He was aware (i.e. worried)'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

It makes little sense that the descriptive verb 'aware' should be an SA verb, but the translation suggests that the meaning implied ('worry') actually includes a more involved argument than the gloss would lead us to think. I appears that while in Tariana split intransitivity is generally sensitive to the distinction between descriptive and non-descriptive verbs, there are some inconsistencies, and more in-depth research would be needed to assess whether these represent merely some idiosyncratic exceptions, or whether agentivity plays some role; and similarly this would beg the question as to whether such a thing were unique to Tariana or might be shared by other Arawak languages as well.

As mentioned, Tariana is unusual for an Arawak language in that it has core case marking. The marking pattern is quite complex, being sensitive not only to grammatical relations, but also to information structure, as shown in table <!--\ref{tariana-case-tbl}-->.[^tariana-gr-table]

|          | A/S                || P or oblique           ||
|          | non-focus | focus   | non-topic | topic       |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| nouns    | -Ø        | -nhe/ne | -Ø        | -nuku/-naku |
| pronouns | -Ø        | -nhe/ne | -na       | -nuku/-naku |
[Core case marking suffixes in Tariana [139][#tariana]][tariana-case-tbl]

A few example sentences illustrate this complex marking system. (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->a) contains an unmarked non-focussed A argument, (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->b) a contrastive topic[^contrastive-topic] S argument, (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->c) a non-topical P argument and (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->d) a topical oblique S (Sio, see below) argument:

[^contrastive-topic]: At least that is my analysis of it, since the argument is not really in focus, as indicated by the gloss. However, the specifics of the case marking system don't matter as much as the sole fact that grammatical relations and information structure are intertwined in a relatively complex way.

\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Such a marking paradigm makes analysis difficult, since information structural properties of constituents are not always clear, especially in absence of special tests or extensive context; Moreover, discourse in Tariana is highly elliptical and arguments don't need to be specified if they can be recovered from context. For that reason I have not attempted to analyse the marking pattern the same way as I have done for the verbal marking. Notice that there is just one particular configuration where A and P cannot be distinguished by case marking, the situation when a noun is neither topic nor focus; in all other constructions, the marking is distinct. Intransitive verbs generally mark their single argument the same as A---except for the small class of verbs that Aikhenvald labels as Sio. This verb class seems to share some similarities with the Sio class in Warekena, in particular there is also an alteration of SP and Sio verbs, where the former indicates a more permanent and the latter a rather temporal property:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[240]{tariana}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll \textbf{wa-na} aĩ ma:tʃi-ma-naka

     we bad-EXC-PRES.VIS 1PL-mouth quick+NCL:ANIM
\glt `We are bad and gossipy (lit. `We are bad and our mouth is quick.').'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

There is however a subtle but important difference between the Sio verb class in the two languages: In Warekena, those verbs marked their argument unlike either A or P; in Tariana, Sio arguments are like P and SP in terms of verbal marking, but like P and unlike SA or SP in terms of case marking. Of course, the terms SA, SP and Sio, which should refer to alignment patterns, become impractical when used to distinguish particular verb classes that align differently in different constructions. I therefore propose a terminologically more precise account, referring just to three intransitive verb classes, I, II and III. One could then observe the following pattern:

|                | I      | II         | III          |
|----------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| verbal marking | SA     | SP         | SP           |
| case marking   | SA     | SA         | SP           |
[Intransitive verb classes and alignment in Tariana]

In other words, Tariana, having two competing ways to mark grammatical relations, has two different kinds of split intransitivity for each of them. This goes even beyond the observation that alignment is construction-specific; it seems as if different constructions may select different classifications for split intransitivity. On the other hand, depending on the size of this class, it could also be argued that it is too insignificant to really constitute a pattern of split intransitivity and might rather be subsumed under the topic of differential subject marking.

[^tariana-gr-table]: I have rearranged and somewhat simplified the table from the original source.

Word order does not seem to depend on grammatical relations, but only on pragmatic considerations. Coreferential NP deletion operates without any pivot restrictions, as discourse in Tariana is highly elliptical. In (<!--\ref{tariana-pivots}-->a), the A argument of the first clause is coreferential to the omitted P argument of the second clause (A=P), and in (<!--\ref{tariana-pivots}-->b), the second clause is missing an SP argument (A=SP).

### Apurinã [apurina]
Apurinã [#facundes00] is spoken in several villages in western Brazil on the river Purus and tributaries.

While Facundes lays out a complex taxonomy of verb classes, here I'm only interested in the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs, and among the latter class between SA and SP verbs. Transitive verbs in Apurinã generally take A prefixes and P suffixes as typical for Arawak languages (<!--\ref{apurina-trans}-->a); these are given in table <!--\ref{apurina-affixes}--> below. The cross-referencing affixes are however dropped in the presence of a pre-verbal full NP or pronoun (but retained when co-occurring with a corresponding post-verbal expression), as (<!--\ref{apurina-trans}-->b-c) show:

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Apurinã [271][#facundes00]][apurina-affixes]

In Apurinã, event or other non-descriptive verbs are always SA verbs, as in other Arawak languages, and therefore also take on prefixes (<!--\ref{apurina-sa}-->); however some descriptive verbs are SA verbs (<!--\ref{apurina-prop-sa}-->), while others are SP verbs (<!--\ref{apurina-prop-sp}-->).

According to Facundes, SP verbs in Apurinã are found in the following semantic domains: size (e.g. *mita*, 'big'), shape (*katapo*, 'crooked'), consistency/texture (*ĩãka*, 'wet'), age of things (*ẽẽĩtu*, 'new'), heat/cold sensations (*potsayã*, 'cold'), spatial deixis (*wai*, 'here') and color (*pomamaru*, 'black'). I don't know however how consistent this pattern is; judging from the examples, it might be that SP verbs indicate more permanent properties---or that at least this was originally how the line between the two classes used to be drawn, even if it may be blurred today because of idiosyncratic lexicalised behaviour of specific verbs. Notice also how similar this is to Baure where also only some descriptive verbs were classified as SP. It is therefore possible that in Baure as well, SP verbs are only found in certain semantic domains of descriptive verbs, contrary to the analysis in [#baure-kurri;]. 

In Apurinã, verbs can also be formed with an attributive marker, of which there are two. The prefix *pa-* attaches only to descriptive verbs---in particular to "bound" roots that cannot appear without affixes. More interesting is the prefix *ka-* which can be used with any kind of root, even non-verbal ones. The negative attributive *m(a)-* (which also triggers an allomorphy in the third person suffixes) works in a similar way, as does the somewhat elusive "privative reversal" marker *wẽ-*, which seems to cancel out negation. All such derived verbs are marked with suffixes:

Word order seems to be quite free, with only VSO order unattested. For that reason it seems reasonable to assume (although this is not specifically discussed by Facundes) that one will not find any kind of split intransitive pattern in word order. I similarly found no clear discussion of pivots in Apurinã, but the following examples seem to indicate that there is no participant deletion either in coordinated or subordinated clauses, but that referents are always expressed either via an affix or a full NP or pronoun. The more interesting question would be what happens in case of two competing third person participants, but I found no specific examples for that case.

### Garifuna
Garifuna (also known as Black Carib or Island Carib) is a particularly interesting Arawak language, not only because it is spoken so far away from the Amazonian---in Mesoamerica, mainly Belize and Honduras. As [376--377][#aikhenvald12;] writes, it shows heavy influences from Carib languages, whose speakers conquered the Arawak tribe (speakers of a language called Iñeri) prior to the advent of the Europeans and killed all men. For a while, three languages coexisted: one used by the Carib conquerors, one by the surviving Iñeri women and a pidgin used by both. Garifuna is a descendant of this mixed language.

According to [#munro07;], Garifuna clauses follow a strict VSO word order although NPs need not be overt. There is no case marking, and arguments are cross-referenced on the verb. There is one set of verbal prefixes and three sets of verbal suffixes for person marking as shown in table <!--\ref{garifuna-affix}-->.[^garifuna-sets] In transitive sentences, A can be marked by a prefix and P by a suffix:[^garifuna-aux]
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{garifuna-trans} \citet[113]{munro07}
\gll Hóu l-umu-tu búrihu fáluma
     eat 3SG.M-TR-T.3SG.F pig coconut
\glt `The pig (m.) ate the coconut (f.).'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^garifuna-sets]: It appears to me the Garifuna suffixes could be further decomposed; the endings are generally the same (e.g. T-series *-tina*, R-series *-dina*, N-series *-nina*), only the initial consonant changes and could thus be considered a "thematic" consonant (which for the reduced series alternates between *d* and a null morpheme).

[^garifuna-aux]: Garifuna makes extensive use of auxiliary verbs; sometimes personal affixes are attached to the main verb as in (<!--\ref{garifuna-a}-->b), sometimes to the auxiliary as in (<!--\ref{garifuna-trans}-->) and sometimes the prefix is attached to the main verb and the suffix to the auxiliary. These subtleties do not appear to be relevant for the purposes of this discussion. In the glosses, I did not use a special label for prefixes (whereas Munro uses P) in order not to confuse it with the semantic primitive P, but retained the labels T, R and N for the different sets of suffixes.

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Garifuna [115][#munro07]][garifuna-affix]

If both a prefix and a suffix occur on the verb, the prefix is used to indicate A and the suffix to indicate P, much as in other Arawak languages. However, unlike A, P is often unmarked in Garifuna, especially when indefinite or nonspecific. In such a case, A can be indicated via either a prefix (<!--\ref{garifuna-a}-->a) or a suffix (<!--\ref{garifuna-a}-->b); the interpretation being that if there is only one affix on the verb it always marks the A argument.
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{garifuna-a} \citet[114]{munro07}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll Hóu l-á Jonathan ába faluma
     eat 3SG.M-AUX J. one coconut
\glt `Jonathan ate a coconut.'
\glend
\item
\gll Hóu-tina bímena
     eat-T.1SG banana
\glt `I eat a banana.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

The choice of whether a prefix or a suffix is used, where it is attached, and, in case of a suffix, which paradigm is employed, seems to be determined by morphosyntactic factors, although these issues are not treated in full detail by [#munro07;]. For example, suffixes always have to appear at the end of the verbal complex (consisting of the full verb and any optional auxiliary) and the transitive auxiliary *(u)mu* always takes T-series suffixes. In any case, examples such as (<!--\ref{garifuna-a}-->a-b) show that the choice is not dictated by the semantics of the verb in question.

A similar picture emerges when considering intransitive verbs. Every such verb may take a T-series suffix to mark its S argument. (<!--\ref{garifuna-itr}-->) shows examples of different kinds of verbs all marked in the same way. In particular, descriptive verbs (<!--\ref{garifuna-itr}-->c) are marked no differently than the rest.
<!--

\glt `The man is stingy.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

This is not enough to conclude that there is no split intransitive pattern at all in Garifuna; it might in theory still be apparent in other constructions. [#munro07;] does not discuss the verbal system in full detail. However, the fact that the original Arawak pattern of consistently marking A and SA with prefixes and P and SP with suffixes is almost lost (except when both A and P are marked), suggests that there is no split intransitive system in Garifuna anymore. Instead the prefix/suffix opposition has become dependent on other morphosyntactic factors of the verbal complex.

Similar to Warekena and Tariana, Garifuna also has a number of semantically intransitive verbs with non-canonically marked argument. However, they are formally not instances of canonical intransitive verbs since they take a dummy third person affix in addition to the adpositionally marked lexical argument: 
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[122]{munro07}
\gll Híruga-ti n-ún
     sad-T.3SG.M 1SG-DAT
\glt `I'm sad.'
\glend
\item \citet[123]{munro07}
\gll Chú-ti t-áu
     smart-T.3SG.M 3SG.F-INSTR
\glt `She's smart.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

According to [#munro07;], there are only ten such intransitive non-canonically marked verbs (plus six transitive ones). This, and the fact that they take a dummy third person affix, points toward the conclusion that even more than similar constructions in Warekena and Tariana, these are best treated as a phenomenon distinct from split intransitivity.

### Wapixana
Wapixana [#wapixana], spoken between the Uraricoera river in Brazil and the Rupununi river in Guyana, is another example of a language that does not exhibit split intransitivity, but its grammar hasn't deviated as much from that of other Arawak languages as Garifuna's has. Transitive verbs are marked with A prefixes and P suffixes, but neither of them seem to be obligatory in the presence of overt NPs, as the following examples show:[^wapixana-trans]
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[160]{wapixana}

\glt `The sun dried the grass.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

There isn't even a set of P suffixes for plural arguments, as shown in table <!--\ref{wapixana-affix}-->.

|     | sg                         || pl                       ||

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Wapixana [159][#wapixana]][wapixana-affix]

[^wapixana-trans]: Glosses and translations are given in Portuguese in [#wapixana;].

All non-descriptive intransitive verbs may take an agreement prefix:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[152]{wapixana}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll ũ-tʃiʔik-p-a-n u-ɖa-ɻu tɨm
     1SG-go-CONT-EP-IND 1SG-parent-F COM
\glt `I'm going with my mother.'
\glend
\item 
\gll  ũ-ɖaʔawɨ-n-niː ũ-ʃimak uwɨʔ
      1SG-sleep-IND-NPRES 1SG-CL:flexible INESS
\glt `I sleep in my hammock.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Properties, however, seem to be expressed via a special adjective word class that ends in *-ʔu*. Even when used verbally, this class may not take affixes (<!--\ref{wapixana-adj}-->a). When the adjective is negated with the particle *auna*, it becomes a verb however. In that case it may take a cross-referencing prefix, as well as other verbal affixes, such as *-n*, indicative mood (<!--\ref{wapixana-adj}-->b).

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{wapixana-adj} \citet[154]{wapixana}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll wɨɽɨː aka-j uʐka-ʔu
     PROX fruit-NPOSS ripe-ADJ

\gll wɨɽɨː aka-j au-na ɨ-uʐka-n
     PROX fruit-NPOSS NEG-DEIX 3SG.M-ripe-IND
\glt `This fruit is not ripe.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

This is enough to conclude that, even though Wapixana still uses a prefix/suffix opposition for distinguishing A and P, there is no pattern of split intransitivity: Properties, which are SP verbs in other Arawak languages, are either non-verbal in nature or, when negated, take prefixes instead of suffixes. 

### Bare [bare]
Bare [#bare], not to be confused with Baure, is a North Arawak language spoken in the Upper Rio Negro region. Verbal marking in Bare is similar to Tariana, but there is no core case marking. A is marked by prefixes on the verb, shown in table <!--\ref{bare-pref}-->, while P is unmarked:[^bare-optional]

[Cross-referencing A prefixes in Bare [27][#bare]][bare-pref]

[^bare-optional]: In certain syntactic constructions or when the constituent is in focus, the A prefix may be replaced by an indefinite *a-* prefix or dropped entirely [see\]\[28--30][#bare].

As in Tariana, intransitive non-descriptive verbs are marked with prefixes, while descriptive verbs are prefixless: 
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item SA verbs
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[29]{bare}
\gll yaháɻika nihíwa nu-dúmaka

     spear good INDF+kill-RECIP-PURP
\glt `Spear is good for fighting.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Interestingly enough, descriptive verbs are prefixless even when used with an inchoative suffix---yielding a dynamic, instead of a stative verb (<!--\ref{bare-inc}-->). Bare also appears to have a class of intransitive verbs with oblique argument (<!--\ref{bare-sio}-->), although Aikhenvald doesn't introduce the term Sio as she does for Warekena and Tariana.
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{bare-inc} \citet[39]{bare}
\gll tʃinu hani waye-d'a
     dog child merry-INC
\glt `The puppy became merry.'

\gll niku-na sabua
     1sg+for-PF sleepy
\glt `I am sleepy.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

Unmarked constituent order in transitive clauses is AVP (<!--\ref{bare-wo}-->a). Aikhenvald claims that, rather unusually, Bare displays a split intransitive pattern even here, with SAV (<!--\ref{bare-wo}-->b) and VSP (<!--\ref{bare-wo}-->c) word orders contrasting: 
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{bare-wo} \citet[44]{bare}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\gll idi hwibudi tʃereká-sa-ka kuhũ
     then electric.eel shock-CAUS-DECL 3SG.NF
\glt `Then the electric eel shocked him.'
\glend
\item

\glt `A lizard is walking on the wall, Yara was under it.'
\glend
\item 
\gll yawi-nu bebi
     angry-1SG 2SG+with
\glt `I am angry with you.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Example (<!--\ref{bare-wo}-->c) is however puzzling: First, because there is no full NP or pronoun for the S argument present---so the claim that Bare has VSP word order cannot be backed up by that example. And second, since contrary to other examples and to what [28][#bare;] claims---that "there are no cross-referencing markers for [P or SP]"---there appears to be a personal suffix. I don't know at this point how to resolve this inconsistency. Since this is an isolated example, I assume it's either an error or an idiosyncratic case, although with the limited data available, it is hard to tell.

Bare has an S/P pivot for coreferential NP deletion. In the following example, the A argument of the first and the P argument of the second clause are coreferential; there seems to be no split intransitive pattern here:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[45]{bare}
\gll kwati i-karuka tʃinu i-baraka
     jaguar 3SG.NF-bite dog 3SG.NF-run
\glt `Jaguar bit the dog and the dog ran.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

### Amuesha
As mentioned before, Andean languages have a typological profile quite distinct from that of Amazonian ones, in particular they generally have accusative alignment systems. Some Arawak languages are in close contact to Andean languages due to geographical proximity; it would therefore be interesting to see whether these languages have kept the Arawak split intransitive pattern or not. One such language that is spoken in the pre-Andine region is Amuesha. Unfortunately, I could not come across detailed and reliable data. The only source that I could access and that was written in a reasonably clear and understable way, was [#amuesha;], which discusses several pre-Andine languages at once, and which devotes no discussion to split intransitivity in Amuesha (although mentioning "stative verbs" briefly for other languages). For this reason, the discussion in this section is particularly sketchy and at times speculative. I still included it because I hope that it may be helpful as a point of departure for further inquiry.

Like other Arawak languages, Amuesha has personal prefixes and suffixes on verbs, shown in table <!--\ref{amuesha-affix}-->, although the situation is special in that third person plural arguments are always marked by a suffix, regardless of their semantic role.[^amuesha-3pl] Due to the high frequency of third person singular arguments, which are generally unmarked, it is hard to find good examples of verbs with both participants shown on the verb. Example (<!--\ref{amuesha-trans}-->) seems to indicate that, as in other Arawak languages, prefixes are used for A arguments and suffixes for P, even if "tell" is not a prototypical transitive verb and the prohibitive construction may influence the shape of the verb in some ways as well. In (<!--\ref{amuesha-3rd}-->) we see that with the third person plural as an A argument, there can in fact be two suffixes (again, "give" as a ditransitive verb is not the best example).

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Amuesha [570][#amuesha]][amuesha-affix]

[^amuesha-3pl]: According to [572][#amuesha;], "if the third person plural suffix agrees with the complement [P] and the subject [A] is not also third person plural [...], it is preceded by -a.n [sic] 'object follows'," so third person plural A and P can still be distinguished in most cases.

There are a number of intransitive verbs with prefixes:
<!--

But there seem to be other verbal constructions requiring a suffix. Wise mentions only the irregular verb *aw-*, 'to go' (<!--\ref{amuesha-sp}-->a), as well as locative (<!--\ref{amuesha-sp}-->b) and equational (<!--\ref{amuesha-sp}-->c) constructions.

There appears to be a separate adjective class with an *-aːz* suffix. In predication it can either be juxtaposed to a noun phrase (<!--\ref{amuesha-adj}-->a) or be used as a verb (<!--\ref{amuesha-adj}-->b):
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{amuesha-adj} \citet[579]{amuesha}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll ña-paʔ at-aːz
     3SG-THEME big-ADJ
\glt `He's big.'
\glend
\item
\gll Ø-at-aːz-t-eːn-a
     3SG-big-ADJ-EP-PROG-REFLX
\glt `He's getting big.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Unfortunately, even though Wise analyses (<!--\ref{amuesha-adj}-->b) with a third person *prefix*, from the example alone it is not clear whether it is really a prefix or a suffix. Even assuming that there are valid reasons for this analysis---maybe examples with other persons would have prefixes as well---the fact that the verb takes a prefix could be an artifact of it being in the progressive mood, thus not stative anymore (although in Bare inchoative descriptive verbs take suffixes, see section <!--\ref{bare}-->). Similarly, for the example in (<!--\ref{amuesha-adj}-->a), it is uncertain whether the adjective really constitutes a separate word class that behaves non-verbally or whether the lack of pronominal affixes is simply due to the fact that third person is unmarked. Lacking data for similar sentences with non-third-person S arguments, it is impossible to say whether Amuesha has a class of descriptive verbs and if so, whether that class takes on prefixes or suffixes. However, the examples in (<!--\ref{amuesha-sp}-->) show that there are still at least some traces of split intransitivity. While the verb "to go" must be considered an exception, equational and locative constructions are very similar semantically to descriptive verbs, so the original Arawak pattern may simply have fossilised there, even if it is not retained elsewhere.

Since Amuesha word order is VSO, there is no possibility for there being a split intransitive pattern.

### Summary of data [results]
In table <!--\ref{langtable}-->, I provide a summary of Arawak languages and their split intransitive marking patterns, as discussed in the previous sections. I indicate the language name and the next higher level subgroup as indicated in [281--285][#aikhenvald02;];[^subgroup] how A and P are distinguished in the transitive clause (in terms of verbal marking); whether there is a split in verbal marking (VM); whether there are splits in other constructions (such as word order (WO) or case marking (CM)); what class(es) of verbs belong to the SP class of verbs; and the source(s) consulted. The most common pattern encountered was the one where A and SA arguments were marked by prefixes and P and SP arguments by suffixes, and the semantic basis for classification was the descriptive/non-descriptive distinction. According to [288--193][#aikhenvald02;], this pattern can also be reconstructed for Proto-Arawak.

[^subgroup]: As noted, internal classification of Arawak languages is controversial. See [180--181][#campbell97;] for an alternative classification.

There are a few interesting observations that might be drawn from this data. 

First, split intransitivity is found in most languages, even when the original prefix/suffix opposition has been lost (as in Kurripako, Tariana or Bare). The split is generally limited to verbal marking, as core case marking is not found outside Tariana, but seems to be apparent in word order as well in some languages.

Second, the two languages that have lost their split intransitive system have done so for different reasons; in Garifuna, the distinction between A and P has itself become blurred and is only really apparent when both are verbally marked. In Wapixana, the semantic class usually treated as SP in other languages (properties) seems to be non-verbal in nature.

Third, the semantic basis used for classification is almost the same across the different languages. In Tariana there is some (non-conclusive) indication that the SP class might have been extended to include significantly affected participants as well, while in Baure and Apurinã by contrast it rather seems to have retreated, including only a subclass of all descriptive verbs. If the conclusions drawn from the data on Amuesha are correct, it appears that the erosion of the SP class has progressed even further there, with only equational and locative clauses being marked by suffixes.

All in all it seems that the split intransitive system in Arawak is relatively stable. [524--537][#mithun91;] notes, by contrast, that the semantic basis has diversified considerably between different languages of the Siouan-Caddoan-Iroquoian family in North America. This is remarkable given the complicated and ongoing contact situation between languages of the Amazon area, although of course the influence of language contact on alignment patterns would require a more detailed study---in particular for languages like Amuesha whose proximity to the usually accusative Andean languages might have caused it to gradually give up its split marking pattern. Also, the internal subgrouping of Arawak seems to give little indication as to which languages show similarities in marking and which ones are different.

I have not addressed in the present thesis how split intransitivity may have evolved historically.[^malchukov] But with the prefix/suffix opposition found in most Arawak languages, and in particular with prefixes and suffixes being very similar or almost identical in most languages, one could speculate about its origins. Maybe the affixes were once independent pronouns, and word order served to distinguish A from P; the grammaticalisation process that turned the pronouns into morphemes dependent on the verb would have to have occured before Proto-Arawak, since it (probably) already showed the same marking pattern as e.g. Warekena. The question remains, in such a scenario, at what point in history exactly the split-intransitive pattern emerged: if this happened before the pronouns turned into affixes, it would mean a (historical) example of split intransitivity in word order.
