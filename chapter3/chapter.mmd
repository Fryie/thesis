# A survey of Arawak languages

## The Arawak languages
Write loads of stuff about the situation in the Amazon, the Arawak languages etc. etc. This is all Aikhenvald, maybe some Campbell.

## Case studies
In order to get an overview over the phenomenon of split intransitivity in Arawak, I collected data from ?? languages, from sources such as grammars, articles and text collections. Of course, most Amazonian languages are poorly, if at all, documented; I couldn't, therefore, be particulary selective about the languages surveyed and had to consider what was readily available. No particular work has been dedicated to ensure the representativeness and balance of the sample, neither in terms of areal distribution, nor of linguistic subgroups within Arawak---which, as previously discussed, are a matter of debate anyway. This, as well as the relatively small size of the sample, and the limited reliability of the sources considered, indicate that the analyses carried out can be exploratory in nature at best, and that in order to get to more meaningful results, more work would have to devoted than is possible in this thesis.

I encountered several difficulties with the data, including the following:

- As confusing as the linguistic situation in the Amazon is, nomenclature does nothing to help. There are a lot of instances where the same name is used for quite unrelated languages, such as Baniwa ?? (ref?), or the two probably unrelated languages, one now extinct, that are called Warekena (see section ??)---problems that arise when either very general endonyms or exonyms are used, or when the cultural identity of a group is mistaken with its linguistic one; the converse problem, where multiple names are used to refer to the same language, arises with Garifuna (see section ??), and it seems unclear whether these really indicate the same language or maybe slightly different variants. More generally, we have to assume both historical and dialectal variation in languages, and as soon any language is being described by more than one source, there is no guarantee that the same variety is being considered after all.
- Arawak languages seem to be generally head-marking, but there is quite a deal of variation as to how obligatory cross-referencing affixes really are. Many languages allow particularly the ellipsis of third person affixes, which may complicate the analysis further.
- I touched on the issue of the defition of verbs briefly in the previous chapter (did I??). When we find (as we will below) that in Arawak languages, patientive intransitive verbs are really property "verbs", not only does this beg the question as to the definition of word classes, but it also means that sources can not be relied upon too much, especially when they mention adjectives as a word class as well. (On this I should elaborate more)
- Of course, the sources themselves are of varying quality; even assuming that the data they recorded is correct, not all of them provide glossed examples, translational equivalents may not be exact, allomorphy may pose analytical problems, they sometimes contradict themselves (Aikhenvald: Bare?) and they sometimes operate in frameworks such as tagmemics that are not easily accessible as of today.

6? of the languages considered I will describe in detail in the sections that follow. I chose languages that are as different from each other as possible, in terms of geography or contact situation, assuming that this would lead to the most variation in the domain of alignment systems as well. Warekena (??) illustrates split intransitivity similar as to how it is found in a lot of other Arawak languages. Tariana (??) is interesting, as it is one of the only Arawak languages with a case system, maybe owing to its long history of contact to Tucanoan languages. Garifuna (??) is the only Arawak language spoken outside South America and has had a very complex history of contact with a number of languages, including Carib and European languages. Amuesha (??) is spoken at the Southern borders of the Amazon region and clearly shows the influence of Andean languages, such as Quechua and Aymara. More?? The remaining ?? languages will be considered more summarily. Table ?? lists some key properties of each language surveyed and also includes the sources consulted.

### Warekena
According to [#aikhenvald98;], Warekena is a North Arawak language spoken along the Xie river, a tributary to the Upper Rio Negro, in Northern Brazil, near the border to Venezuela. Apparently, the Warekena people used to speak another language, called by Aikhenvald the "old" Warekena (and classified as part of the Içana-Vaupes subgroup), which is in part documented in earlier literature; later however, most of the Warekena people adopted a dialect of Baniwa of Guainia as the "new" Warekena, described here. Those two varieties are not mutually intelligible, which means that the literature, which does not generally distinguish between them, can be misleading. Warekena is currently in a state of acute endangerment, given that the language is only spoken by people over fifty and not used in everyday communication anymore.

In Warekena, A arguments are cross-referenced by prefixes, which incidentally are the same ones used to indicate possessors on nouns, and P arguments by suffixes on the verb.[^enclitics] This prefix/suffix opposition is quite typical for Arawak languages, as will become apparent later. The Warekena affixes are given in the following table[293][#aikhenvald98]:[^impersonal]

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Warekena]

[^enclitics]: Warekena, according to Aikhenvald, uses prefixes and enclitics. The distinction between affixes and clitics is however not significant for the analysis in the present thesis.

[^impersonal]: I omit from this table (as well as from subsequent ones) the impersonal prefix; it is of no particular interest to the present discussion.

As is readily apparent, the prefixes and suffixes are almost identical, save for the position with respect to the verbal head. One could speculate as to the origin of this marking pattern: Maybe the affixes (or clitics) were once independent pronouns, and word order served to distinguish A from P; the grammaticalisation process that turned the pronouns into morphemes dependent on the verb would have to have occured before Proto-Arawak, since according to reconstructions it already showed the same marking patterns as Warekena (??). The question remains, in such a scenario, at what point in history exactly the split-intransitive pattern (described below) emerged: if this happened before the pronouns turned into affixes, it would mean a (historical) example of the rather rare type of split intransitivity in word order.

As discussed before, in many languages the absence of overt third person affixes complicate the analysis of argument marking. In Warekena, non-feminine third person singular is generally unmarked (except when in focus; in that case the *i-* prefix is used) and all third person P suffixes can be elided in the presence of full NPs; thus not all constructions make the agreement system and the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs readily apparent. A few examples of transitive sentences are given below:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[359]{aikhenvald98}
\gll yu-tawina-na nu-ʃuɺuami
     3SG.F-grow-1SG 1SG-mother
\glt `My mother brought me up.'
\glend
\item \citet[360]{aikhenvald98}
\gll nu-bukuita-mia aʃi
     1SG-lit-PERF fire
\glt `I lit the fire.'
\glend
\item \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\gll mutʃita-na umeni
     bite-1SG snake
\glt `A snake bit me.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

In (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) we can see both an A prefix and a P suffix (since both feminine third person and first person are overtly marked), but in the next two examples only one argument is marked: the P argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->b) and the A argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c) are third person non-feminine singular and therefore get zero marking.

At first glance, Warekena exhibits a classic case of split intransitivity: There is a class of Sa verbs that always get prefix marking and a class of Sp verbs that are always marked by suffixes.[^ware-o-p] What is cross-linguistically remarkable, however, is the domain of the split. Verbs such as *go*, which are volitional and dynamic, are of course Sa verbs, but many verbs that would be marked as Sp in other split intransitive languages, are Sa verbs in Warekena, such as *die*, which is non-agentive and would be marked as Sp e.g. in Lakhota, or *lie*, which is stative and would be an Sp verb in languages like Guaraní. Consider:

[^ware-o-p]: Consistent with previous terminology, I employ the symbols P and Sp, instead of Aikhenvald's O and So.

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\gll tsume \textbf{nu-wiyua-hã} \textbf{nu-yuɺuta-wa} peya tsemana bitsewe-hẽ wa: \textbf{i-tapa-mia-hã} nuʃiwa awi-ni umeni
      almost 1SG-die-PAUS 1SG-lie-NONACC one week hammock+LOC-PAUS then 3SG.NF-go-PERF-PAUS 1SG+from pain-DEM:PR snake
\glt `I almost died, I was lying in a hammock for a week, then the pain of the snake went away from me.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

Similarly, Aikhenvald mentions verbs such as *fall*, *drown*, *cough* or *sleep* as examples for Sa verbs. Sp verbs, by contrast, generally denote properties (<!--\ref{ware-sp}-->a-b), although there are some idosyncratic exceptions (<!--\ref{ware-sp}-->c):

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware-sp} \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll kutʃa-na
     wet-1SG
\glt `I am wet.'
\glend
\item
\gll wa-hã anua-na
     then-PAUS ill-1SG
\glt `Then i was ill.'
\glend
\item
\gll aɺiwa-wi
     get.up.early-1PL
\glt `Good morning (Lit.: we got up early).'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Aikhenvald also points out that due to the fuzziness of word classes in Warekena, almost any nominal, pronominal or adjectival root can be used as an Sp verb. One may therefore wonder whether it is appropriate to include properties ...

There is also a third class of verbs that Aikhenvald mentions: These take an oblique argument marked by the preposition *yue*, 'to, for'. This is a small class and furthermore any such verb can also be used as an Sp verb, with a slight change of meaning:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[363]{aikhenvald98}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-yue mawaɺi
     1SG-for hungry
\glt `I am hungry (just now).'
\glend
\item
\gll mawaɺi-na
     hungry-1SG
\glt `I am hungry (permanently).'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

For reasons mentioned in ??, I maintain that these should be analysed as non-canonical subjects; for this reason I don't think they're particularly relevant to the discussion of split intransitivity. Note however that this class of verbs seems to be present in other languages described by Aikhenvald (such as Tariana or Bare?, see ...).

In the previous discussion I have described cross-referencing affixes on the verb, but as noted in ??, alignment patterns can be apparent in other parts of grammar as well. Warekena, as most Arawak languages, has no core case marking, but of Donohue's three main ?, word order remains. Aikhenvald mentions that the unmarked word order in transitive clauses is AVP and that in the intransitive clause Sa aligns with A and Sp with P; that is, word order would be split intransitive as well. Examples such as (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) and (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c) seem to contradict this, but maybe these are cases of marked word order. In any way, without significantly more text samples, it is hard to tell how exactly word order behaves in terms of alignment.

Warekena has a mixed pivot: some constructions are sensitive to the S/A alignment, while others operate in terms of S and P. Equi-NP deletion in coordinated clauses is an example of the former:[^pivot-1-2]

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware-equi-1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[235]{aikhenvald98}
\gll enami eda waʃi paɺa-mia
     man perceive jaguar run-PERF
\glt `A man saw a jaguar and the jaguar ran.'
\glend
\item \citet[236]{aikhenvald98}
\gll enami eda-hã waʃi paɺa-mia enami 
     man perceive-PAUS jaguar run-PERF man
\glt `A man saw a jaguar and ran.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{ware-equi-2} \citet[236]{aikhenvald98}
\gll wa ma-kaɺe-mia-hã ema waʃi mutʃita-mia-hã
     then NEG-breath-PERF-PAUS tapir jaguar bite-PERF-PAUS
\glt `Then the tapir grew tired, and the jaguar bit him.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^pivot-1-2]: Notice that there are no pivot restrictions for first and second persons, since they are always obligatorily marked.

Example (<!--\ref{ware-equi-1}-->a) illustrates that the ellipsed S constituent in the second clause (the argument of the verb 'to run') is coreferential with the P argument of the first, while (<!--\ref{ware-equi-1}-->b) shows that the A argument cannot be ellipsed in the same way. In (<!--\ref{ware-equi-2}-->) we can see that Sp behaves the same as Sa in terms of pivot restrictions; thus there is no split intransitive pattern apparent in Equi-NP deletion.[^breathless]

However, in presence of the presentative conjunction *wa(-hã)*, Equi-NP deletion seems to operate with respect to an S/A pivot instead. In the following example, the third person non-feminine singular S argument from the first clause is maintained as an A argument throughout:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[237]{aikhenvald98}
\gll wa-hã ʃa wa neta-hã peya neyawa i-ʃumiawa wa: apiñaya-yu pane-waba
     then-PAUS go then ask-PAUS one woman 3SG.F-wife+FEM then bring-3SG.F house-DIR
\glt `Then he went, then he asked another woman to be his wife, then he brought her home.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^breathless]: It may not be readily apparent, but *ma-kaɺe*, 'breathless, tired from work/running', is listed as an Sp verb (p. 362), and seems to be an example of a verb formed from a nominal root.

Other types of constructions that are sensitive to an S/A pivot include certain types of subordinate clauses, e.g. locative clauses:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[282]{aikhenvald98}
\gll kuɺimaɺu nupa-mia-wa waɺi yutsia ema
     turtle arrive-PERF-NONACC where kill tapir
\glt `Turtle arrived to where he killed the tapir.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

All in all, pivots in Warekena seem to be rather complex, but there seems to be no evidence that they exhibit an Sa/Sp split along the lines that verbal affixes (and maybe word order) do.

### Garifuna
[#munro07] blahblah!

### Kurripako
In Kurripako [#baure-kurri], another North Arawak language spoken around the borders of Venezuela, Columbia and Brazil, A arguments are marked as prefixes on the verb, while P arguments are expressed post-verbally via independent pronouns (or full noun phrases). The exception are third person P arguments for which suffixes still exist:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{kurri-trans} \citet[399]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-heema kalaka
     1SG-barbecue chicken
\glt `I barbecue the chicken.'
\glend
\item
\gll nu-heema srua
     1SG-barbecue 3SG.F
\glt `I barbecue it.'
\glend
\item
\gll nu-heema-no
     1SG-barbecue-3SG.F
\glt `I barbecue it.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

(<!--\ref{kurri-trans}-->) provides three transitive verb constructions describing the same situation, using a full noun phrase, an independent pronoun and a pronominal suffix respectively; notice how the pronoun and the suffix seemingly have no resemblance to each other.

The full table of pronominal affixes is given below; unfortunately <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> don't provide a similar table for the independent pronouns.

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||
|     | A prefixes    | P suffixes  | A prefixes  | P suffixes  |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1   | nu-           |             | wa-         |             |
| 2   | pi-           |             | i-          |             |
| 3M  | li-           | -ni         | na-         | -na         |
| 3F  | ru-           | -no         | na-         | -na         |
| 3FOC| i-            |             | na-         |             |
[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Kurripako]

Even though the prefix/suffix opposition is largely lost in Kurripako, the language still works in split intransitive terms the same as Warekena, as shown by the following examples:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[398]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-dia-ka-wa panti-liku
     1SG-return-PROG-INTR house-LOC
\glt `I am returning into the house.'
\glend
\item
\gll haamaa-ka hnua
     tired-PROG 1SG
\glt `I am tired.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Verbs such as 'return' are Sa verbs in Kurripako, while a property verb like 'be tired' is an Sp verb, much as it was the case in Warekena; the only difference is that Sp verbs are not marked by suffixes but via independent pronouns.[^kurri-3]

The example of Kurripako shows that while in many Arawak languages the split intransitive pattern is based on a prefix/suffix opposition, this opposition remains present even after the (partial) loss of suffixes; it seems as if a new pattern, involving independent pronouns, was created to fill the gap thus created.

[^kurri-3]: Unfortunately, with the few examples provided it is not possible to decide, but it stands to reason that third person Sp arguments could be marked via suffixes the same as the P argument in (<!--\ref{kurri-trans}-->c).

It has additionally to be noted about Kurripako that Aikhenvald (??) considers it to be same language as Baniwa of Içana, which is described as a fluid-S language by [81][#dixon94;]. The descriptions however do not seem quite to match: According to Dixon, Baniwa of Içana uses a prefix vs. suffix system not unlike Warekena; additionally "die" is described as an example of an Sp verb. It is hard to see how such a discrepancy came to be, especially since Dixon explicitly cites Aikhenvald as a source of personal communication.[^baniwa-taylor] Maybe the two languages are distinct after all or maybe the different authors chose to describe different varieties; maybe it is simply the quality of the data that is at fault. In any case, situations like this one illustrate the challenges associated with a comparative study of languages that are so poorly described as the Amazonian ones are.

[^baniwa-taylor]: I could, unfortunately, not get my hands on the other reference Dixon cites, a 1991 grammar written in Portuguese[see the reference in\]\[81][#dixon94].

### Baure
[#baure-kurri;] contrast Kurripako with Baure, a South Arawak language spoken in Bolivia near the border to Brazil. Superficially the two are quite distinct: Baure has retained the prefix/suffix opposition (although they are analysed as clitics by <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}-->.) as can be seen in (<!--\ref{baure-trans}-->a), which also shows the use of an overt independent pronoun (used for emphasis) that however does not replace the personal proclitic. (<!--\ref{baure-trans}-->b) shows that the P enclitic is dropped in the presence of an overt NP:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-trans} \citet[401]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nti' ni=komorik p-a-š simori
     1SG 1SG=kill one-CLF:animal pig
\glt `I killed one pig.'
\glend
\item
\gll heni, ver ni=komorikie=ro
     yes PVF 1SG=kill=3SG.M
\glt `Yes, I already killed it.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

The full set of agreement clitics is given in the following table:

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||
|     | A prefixes    | P suffixes  | A prefixes  | P suffixes  |

[Cross-referencing verbal clitics in Baure]

<!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> argue that the split intransitive pattern in Baure is quite distinct from the one in Kurripako. While the Sa marking in (<!--\ref{baure-sa}-->) is consistent with Kurripako, the examples in (<!--\ref{baure-non-sp}-->) would be Sp verbs in Kurripako, but are marked with proclitics in Baure:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-sa} \citet[400]{baure-kurri}
\gll vi=šim ač vi=kowyo-po ač vi=imok
     1PL=arrive and 1PL=bathe-PRFLX and 1PL=sleep
\glt `We arrive, we take a bath (bathe ourselves), and we sleep.'
\glend
\item\label{baure-non-sp}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[401]{baure-kurri}
\gll vi=ha'ino-wo
     1PL-tired-COP
\glt `We are tired.'
\glend
\item \citet[402]{baure-kurri}
\gll ni=mane-wapa
     1SG=cold-COS
\glt `I am cold/I got cold.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

The argument goes that the split is not between stative and dynamic verbs, as they analyse Kurripako,[^kurripako-stative] but between verbal and nonverbal predicates. This is illustrated by the following examples of Sp verbs:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-sp} \citet[402]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll monči-wo=ni
     child-COP=1SG
\glt `I was a child.'
\glend
\item
\gll mehewkon-wape=ro
     bad-COS=3SG.M
\glt `It is bad.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

This seeems like a contrived argument to me, however. Distinctions between verbs and other word classes, especially adjectives, are not obvious in many languages if they exist at all, and, as mentioned before, [#aikhenvald98;] explicitly states that their boundaries are fuzzy in Warekena. From the examples provided it might seem as if Baure has a more explicit distinction since nonverbal roots appear either with a copular or with a "change of state" suffix, but then how does that explain the presence of the suffix both on Sa verbs (<!--\ref{baure-non-sp}-->) and Sp verbs (<!--\ref{baure-sp}-->)? I fail to see a principled difference between 'cold', 'tired' and 'bad' and why the former two could be called examples of stative verbs and the latter an adjective. In any case, <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> do not discuss this issue. It is therefore hard to understand what the split in argument marking really consists of. It may be that the split intransitive pattern in Baure is retreating and that the proclitic marking is being generalised, such that more and more former Sp verbs are used as Sa verbs, but without more examples it is hard to tell; the split in Baure appears therefore to be quite idiosyncratic in nature (although this only concerns property verbs; non-property verbs are always Sa verbs as in other Arawak languages).

[^kurripako-stative]: I also question that the pattern in Kurripako can be analysed as a distinction between stative and dynamic verbs, but I will come back to this question WHERE?

### Tariana
Tariana is blahblahblah Vaupes, Tucano, blah

Tariana is probably the best described Arawak language by far, with its reference grammar [#tariana] being over 600 pages long. This means that I will have to limit my description to the most salient aspects.

Tariana is one of the few Arawak languages with core case marking; this is probably due to influence from the neighbouring Tucanoan languages. This means that a discussion of split intransitivity will have to consider case marking in addition to verbal cross-referencing (and word order).

The situation with respect to verbal marking is easier. Arawak suffixes are lost in Tariana and only the prefixes remain. A arguments are cross-referenced by prefixes, while P arguments are not marked at all on the verb, as shown by the transitive verb *-inu*, 'kill':

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[235]{tariana}
\gll di-na na-inu-kasu-pidana nha iɾi-ne
     3SG.NF-OBJ 3PL-kill-INT-REM.P.REP they blood-PL
\glt `The ``Irine'' (i.e. the Tariana, lit. people of the blood) were going to kill him.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

The full listing of personal prefixes is given below.

|     | singular      | plural      |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 1   | nu-           | wa-         | 
| 2   | pi-           | i-          |
| 3F  | du-           | na-         |
| 3NF | di-           | na-         |
[Cross-referencing verbal A prefixes in Warekena [122][#tariana]]

The split in verbal cross-referencing is evident in that some intransitive verbs take personal prefixes whereas others don't. Since the S argument is sometimes marked the same as A (with a prefix) and sometimes the same as P (i.e., not at all), this satisfies our definition of split intransitivity. The following examples illustrate that:

<!--

\item Sa verbs \citep[239]{tariana}

As for Warekena, Aikhenvald distinguishes an Sio class of verbs (<!--\ref{tariana-sp}-->b) from the Sp class ("So" in her terminology); however, as far as verbal marking is concerned, there is no distinction: both simply don't mark their argument. The distinction may become relevant with case marking, as I will discuss shortly.

Since Aikhenvald does not treat the semantic basis of the split in particular depth and given the wealth of textual data in [#tariana-texts,tariana;], I decided to investigate which verbs were marked as Sa and which were marked as Sp, concentrating only on verbal cross-referencing. I found that Sp verbs were much (on one or two orders of magnitude) rarer than Sa verbs. However, it is also possible that I missed some interesting examples; since Sp verbs have no personal affixes it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them from other parts of speech, in particular since tense-evidentiality markers are enclitics that may attach to any part of speech [288][#tariana], as the remote past inferred marker *-pidana* in the following example:

<!--

\glend
\end{examples}

[Some Sp verbs in Tariana texts]

One can immediately see the wide range of verbs that belong to the Sa class. It's especially apparent here that the split does not operate in terms of agency or dynamicity (with non-agentive verbs such as 'die' or stative verbs such as 'stay' being Sa verbs). Unfortunately, there are not many examples of Sp verbs (Sa verbs are much more common and I only showed a few selected ones here). Most of them are property verbs, but some do not seem to fit the pattern, such as 'appear' or 'emit sound', which might be idiosyncratic exceptions. I think however that this is different in the case of 'split'. To avoid confusion it has to be noted that the Arawak verb in question translates to the intransitive use of the verb 'split' (as in something splitting after being cut in half), not the transitive one. [239][#tariana;] mentions some similar examples as Sp verbs, such as the near-synonym *ke:ka*, 'split open' or *lama*, 'burn, get burnt', as in the following example:

WRITE ABOUT EXTENDED INTRANSITIVES SOMEWHERE---actually problematic, but can also be used without extension, so o.k.:
(exs p. 243)

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[239]{tariana}
\gll lama-sina diha-dapana
     burn-REP.NONVIS ART-CL:HAB
\glt `This house was burning.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

Of course, this is still a small number of verbs that could just be behaving idiosyncratically. However, the verbs have in common that their S argument is very strongly affected by the action, a property generally associated with patients. Even if in Tariana, agentivity is not the key factor in deciding whether a verb is Sa or Sp, it might be that in cases where the argument is particularly affected there is a tendency to treat it as an Sp argument. Of course, there is at least one strong counterexample (the verb *yãmi*, 'die'), and it is not clear how many (if any) verbs behave similarly; and if this is indeed a pattern in Tariana, it's hard to tell whether this is an innovation of this particular language (maybe a reanalysis of split intransitivity in progress) or whether similar patterns can be found in other Arawak languages as well. Another argument in favour of the hypothesis that agentivity may play some (minor) role in Tariana's split intransitive system, is the Sa verb *anihta*, 'aware':

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[77]{tariana-texts}
\gll diha di-anihta-tha-pidana
     he 3SG.NF-aware-FR-REM.P.INFR
\glt `He was aware (i.e. worried)'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

It makes little sense that the property verb 'aware' should be an Sa verb, but the translation suggests that the meaning implied ('worry') actually includes a more agentive argument than the gloss would lead us to think. However, there are also other verbs for which I can't think of an explanation right away, such as *yami*, 'be unconscious', as in (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->b) below, which also should not be an Sa verb. I can only conclude this issue by saying that while in Tariana split intransitivity seems to generally be sensitive to property verbs, there are some inconsistencies, and more in-depth research would be needed to assess whether these represent merely some idiosyncratic exceptions or have other reasons (similar to the Spanish loanwords in Guaraní ... see section ??), or whether agentivity plays some role; and similarly this would beg the question as to whether such a thing were unique to Tariana or might be shared by other Arawak languages as well.

As mentioned, Tariana is unusual for an Arawak language in that it has core case marking. The marking pattern is quite complex, being sensitive not only to grammatical relations, but also to information structure, as shown in the following table:[^tariana-gr-table]

|          | A/S                || P or oblique           ||
|          | non-focus | focus   | non-topic | topic       |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| nouns    | -Ø        | -nhe/ne | -Ø        | -nuku/-naku |
| pronouns | -Ø        | -nhe/ne | -na       | -nuku/-naku |
[Core case marking suffixes in Tariana [139][#tariana]]

A few example sentences illustrate this complex marking system. (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->a) contains an unmarked non-focussed A argument, (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->b) a contrastive topic[^contrastive-topic] S argument, (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->c) a non-topical P argument and (<!--\ref{tariana-case}-->d) a topical oblique S (Sio, see below) argument:

[^contrastive-topic]: At least that is my analysis of it, since the argument is not really in focus, as indicated by the gloss. However, the specifics of the case marking system don't matter as much as the sole fact that grammatical relations and information structure are intertwined in a relatively complex way.

-->

Such a marking paradigm makes analysis difficult, since information structural properties of constituents are not always clear, especially in absence of special tests or extensive context; add to that the fact that discourse in Tariana is highly elliptical and arguments don't need to be specified if they can be recovered from context. For that reason I have not attempted to analyse the marking pattern the same way as I have done for the verbal marking. Notice that there is just one particular configuration where A and P cannot be distinguished by case marking, the situation when a noun is neither topic nor focus; in all other constructions, the marking is distinct. According to Aikhenvald, intransitive verbs generally mark their single argument the same as A---except for the small class of verbs that she labels as Sio. This verb class seems to share some similarities with the ononymous class in Warekena, in particular there is also an alteration of Sp and Sio verbs, where the former indicates a more permanent and the latter a rather temporal property:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[240]{tariana}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll \textbf{wa-na} aĩ ma:tʃi-ma-naka
     1PL-OBJ here bad-EXC-PRES.VIS
\glt `We are here in a very bad way.'
\glend
\item
\gll \textbf{waha} ma:tʃi-ma-naka wa-numa sewite
     we bad-EXC-PRES.VIS 1PL-mouth quick+NCL:ANIM
\glt `We are bad and gossipy (lit. `We are bad and our mouth is quick.').'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Notice however the different status of Sio verbs in Tariana: In Warekena, those verbs marked their argument unlike either A or P; in Tariana, Sio arguments are like P and Sp in terms of verbal marking, but like P and unlike Sa in terms of case marking. Of course, the terms Sa, Sp and Sio, which should refer to alignment patterns, become impractical when used to distinguish particular verb classes that align differently in different constructions. I therefore propose a terminologically more precise account, referring just to three intransitive verb classes, I, II and III. One could then observe the following pattern:

|                | I      | II         | III          |
|----------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| verbal marking | Sa     | Sp         | Sp           |
| case marking   | Sa     | Sa         | Sp           |
[Intransitive verb classes and alignment in Tariana]

In other words, Tariana, having two competing ways to mark grammatical relations, has two different kinds of split intransitivity for each of them. This is similar to ... Bickel. On the other hand, depending on the size of this class, it could also be argued that it is too insignificant to really constitute a pattern of split intransitivity and might rather be subsumed under the topic of differential subject marking (see the discussion in section ??).

[^tariana-gr-table]: I have rearranged and somewhat simplified the table from the original source.

pivots etc. many ellipses!

One further note has to be made that unlike other Arawak languages, Tariana does indeed seem to have an adjective word class that is not simply a subclass of verbs, but has properties distinct from both nouns and verbs. However, when used predicatively, they seem to behave like verbs, which is why I think that this issue is not really important (maybe this should not be in the Tariana section, but in the theory or data section).

### Apurinã
Apurinã river Purus blahblah [#facundes00].

While Facundes has a complex taxonomy of all verb classes, here I'm only interested in the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs, and among the latter class between Sa and Sp verbs. Transitive verbs in Apurinã generally take A prefixes and P suffixes as typical for Arawak languages (<!--\ref{apurina-trans}-->a). The cross-referencing affixes are however dropped in the presence of a pre-verbal full NP or pronoun (but retained when co-occurring with a corresponding post-verbal expression), as (<!--\ref{apurina-trans}-->b-c) show:

write something about glosses and how i changed them but kept spelling original...

ALTHOUGH IN WAREKENA, WHICH MAY BE A TYPICAL EXAMPLE AND VERY WELL REFLECT THE SITUATION IN PROTO-ARAWAK, SPLIT INTRANSITIVITY IS MANIFEST VIA THE PREFIX/SUFFIX OPPOSITION, THE TWO MAY EVOLVE INDEPENDENTLY: IN KURRIPAKO, THE SPLIT IS KEPT ALTHOUGH THE SUFFIXES ARE LARGELY LOST; ON THE OTHER HAND, GARIFUNA KEEPS THIS OPPOSITION EVEN THOUGH THE SPLIT INTRANSITIVE PATTERN IS ABSENT.

say that I only investigated "prototypical" verbs, and explicitly left out existential, copular etc. verbs even though they might be interesting in their own right---see e.g. Apurinã existential *awa*, which sometimes seems to cooccur with an object pronominal marker similar to Sp verbs.
