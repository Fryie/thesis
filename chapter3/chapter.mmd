# A survey of Arawak languages

## The Arawak languages
Write loads of stuff about the situation in the Amazon, the Arawak languages etc. etc. This is all Aikhenvald, maybe some Campbell.

## Case studies

### The data
In order to get an overview over the phenomenon of split intransitivity in Arawak, I collected data from ?? languages, from sources such as grammars, articles and text collections. Of course, most Amazonian languages are poorly, if at all, documented; I couldn't, therefore, be particulary selective about the languages surveyed and had to consider what was readily available. No particular work has been dedicated to ensure the representativeness and balance of the sample, neither in terms of areal distribution, nor of linguistic subgroups within Arawak---which, as previously discussed, are a matter of debate anyway. This, as well as the relatively small size of the sample, and the limited reliability of the sources considered, indicate that the analyses carried out can be exploratory in nature at best, and that in order to get to more meaningful results, more work would have to devoted than is possible in this thesis.

I encountered several difficulties with the data, including the following:

- As confusing as the linguistic situation in the Amazon is, nomenclature does nothing to help. There are a lot of instances where the same name is used for quite unrelated languages, such as Baniwa ?? (ref?), or the two probably unrelated languages, one now extinct, that are called Warekena (see section ??)---problems that arise when either very general endonyms or exonyms are used, or when the cultural identity of a group is mistaken with its linguistic one; the converse problem, where multiple names are used to refer to the same language, arises with Garifuna (see section ??), and it seems unclear whether these really indicate the same language or maybe slightly different variants. More generally, we have to assume both historical and dialectal variation in languages, and as soon any language is being described by more than one source, there is no guarantee that the same variety is being considered after all.
- Arawak languages seem to be generally head-marking, but there is quite a deal of variation as to how obligatory cross-referencing affixes really are. Many languages allow particularly the ellipsis of third person affixes, which may complicate the analysis further.
- I touched on the issue of the defition of verbs briefly in the previous chapter (did I??). When we find (as we will below) that in Arawak languages, patientive intransitive verbs are really property "verbs", not only does this beg the question as to the definition of word classes, but it also means that sources can not be relied upon too much, especially when they mention adjectives as a word class as well. (On this I should elaborate more)
- Of course, the sources themselves are of varying quality; even assuming that the data they recorded is correct, not all of them provide glossed examples, translational equivalents may not be exact, allomorphy may pose analytical problems, they sometimes contradict themselves (Aikhenvald: Bare?) and they sometimes operate in frameworks such as tagmemics that are not easily accessible as of today.

6? of the languages considered I will describe in detail in the sections that follow. I chose languages that are as different from each other as possible, in terms of geography or contact situation, assuming that this would lead to the most variation in the domain of alignment systems as well. Warekena (??) illustrates split intransitivity similar as to how it is found in a lot of other Arawak languages. Tariana (??) is interesting, as it is one of the only Arawak languages with a case system, maybe owing to its long history of contact to Tucanoan languages. Garifuna (??) is the only Arawak language spoken outside South America and has had a very complex history of contact with a number of languages, including Carib and European languages. Amuesha (??) is spoken at the Southern borders of the Amazon region and clearly shows the influence of Andean languages, such as Quechua and Aymara. More?? The remaining ?? languages will be considered more summarily. Table ?? lists some key properties of each language surveyed and also includes the sources consulted.

### Warekena
According to [#aikhenvald98;], Warekena is a North Arawak language spoken along the Xie river, a tributary to the Upper Rio Negro, in Northern Brazil, near the border to Venezuela. Apparently, the Warekena people used to speak another language, called by Aikhenvald the "old" Warekena (and classified as part of the Içana-Vaupes subgroup), which is in part documented in earlier literature; later however, most of the Warekena people adopted a dialect of Baniwa of Guainia as the "new" Warekena, described here. Those two varieties are not mutually intelligible, which means that the literature, which does not generally distinguish between them, can be misleading. Warekena is currently in a state of acute endangerment, given that the language is only spoken by people over fifty and not used in everyday communication anymore.

In Warekena, A arguments are cross-referenced by prefixes, which incidentally are the same ones used to indicate possessors on nouns, and P arguments by suffixes on the verb.[^enclitics] This prefix/suffix opposition is quite typical for Arawak languages, as will become apparent later. The Warekena affixes are given in the following table[293][#aikhenvald98]:[^impersonal]

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||

[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Warekena]

[^enclitics]: Warekena, according to Aikhenvald, uses prefixes and enclitics. The distinction between affixes and clitics is however not significant for the analysis in the present thesis.

[^impersonal]: I omit from this table (as well as from subsequent ones) the impersonal prefix; it is of no particular interest to the present discussion.

As is readily apparent, the prefixes and suffixes are almost identical, save for the position with respect to the verbal head. One could speculate as to the origin of this marking pattern: Maybe the affixes (or clitics) were once independent pronouns, and word order served to distinguish A from P; the grammaticalisation process that turned the pronouns into morphemes dependent on the verb would have to have occured before Proto-Arawak, since according to reconstructions it already showed the same marking patterns as Warekena (??). The question remains, in such a scenario, at what point in history exactly the split-intransitive pattern (described below) emerged: if this happened before the pronouns turned into affixes, it would mean a (historical) example of the rather rare type of split intransitivity in word order.

As discussed before, in many languages the absence of overt third person affixes complicate the analysis of argument marking. In Warekena, non-feminine third person singular is generally unmarked (except when in focus; in that case the *i-* prefix is used) and all third person P suffixes can be elided in the presence of full NPs; thus not all constructions make the agreement system and the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs readily apparent. A few examples of transitive sentences are given below:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[359]{aikhenvald98}
\gll yu-tawina-na nu-ʃuɺuami
     3SG.F-grow-1SG 1SG-mother
\glt `My mother brought me up.'
\glend
\item \citet[360]{aikhenvald98}
\gll nu-bukuita-mia aʃi
     1SG-lit-PERF fire
\glt `I lit the fire.'
\glend
\item \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\gll mutʃita-na umeni
     bite-1SG snake
\glt `A snake bit me.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

In (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) we can see both an A prefix and a P suffix (since both feminine third person and first person are overtly marked), but in the next two examples only one argument is marked: the P argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->b) and the A argument in (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c) are third person non-feminine singular and therefore get zero marking.

At first glance, Warekena exhibits a classic case of split intransitivity: There is a class of Sa verbs that always get prefix marking and a class of Sp verbs that are always marked by suffixes.[^ware-o-p] What is cross-linguistically remarkable, however, is the domain of the split. Verbs such as *go*, which are volitional and dynamic, are of course Sa verbs, but many verbs that would be marked as Sp in other split intransitive languages, are Sa verbs in Warekena, such as *die*, which is non-agentive and would be marked as Sp e.g. in Lakhota, or *lie*, which is stative and would be an Sp verb in languages like Guaraní. Consider:

[^ware-o-p]: Consistent with previous terminology, I employ the symbols P and Sp, instead of Aikhenvald's O and So.

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\gll tsume \textbf{nu-wiyua-hã} \textbf{nu-yuɺuta-wa} peya tsemana bitsewe-hẽ wa: \textbf{i-tapa-mia-hã} nuʃiwa awi-ni umeni
      almost 1SG-die-PAUS 1SG-lie-NONACC one week hammock+LOC-PAUS then 3SG.NF-go-PERF-PAUS 1SG+from pain-DEM:PR snake
\glt `I almost died, I was lying in a hammock for a week, then the pain of the snake went away from me.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

Similarly, Aikhenvald mentions verbs such as *fall*, *drown*, *cough* or *sleep* as examples for Sa verbs. Sp verbs, by contrast, generally denote properties (<!--\ref{ware-sp}-->a-b), although there are some idosyncratic exceptions (<!--\ref{ware-sp}-->c):
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware-sp} \citet[362]{aikhenvald98}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll kutʃa-na
     wet-1SG
\glt `I am wet.'
\glend
\item
\gll wa-hã anua-na
     then-PAUS ill-1SG
\glt `Then i was ill.'
\glend
\item
\gll aɺiwa-wi
     get.up.early-1PL
\glt `Good morning (Lit.: we got up early).'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Aikhenvald also points out that due to the fuzziness of word classes in Warekena, almost any nominal, pronominal or adjectival root can be used as an Sp verb. One may therefore wonder whether it is appropriate to include properties ...

There is also a third class of verbs that Aikhenvald mentions: These take an oblique argument marked by the preposition *yue*, 'to, for'. This is a small class and furthermore any such verb can also be used as an Sp verb, with a slight change of meaning:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[363]{aikhenvald98}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-yue mawaɺi
     1SG-for hungry
\glt `I am hungry (just now).'
\glend
\item
\gll mawaɺi-na
     hungry-1SG
\glt `I am hungry (permanently).'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

For reasons mentioned in ??, I maintain that these should be analysed as non-canonical subjects; for this reason I don't think they're particularly relevant to the discussion of split intransitivity. Note however that this class of verbs seems to be present in other languages described by Aikhenvald (such as Tariana or Bare?, see ...).

In the previous discussion I have described cross-referencing affixes on the verb, but as noted in ??, alignment patterns can be apparent in other parts of grammar as well. Warekena, as most Arawak languages, has no core case marking, but of Donohue's three main ?, word order remains. Aikhenvald mentions that the unmarked word order in transitive clauses is AVP and that in the intransitive clause Sa aligns with A and Sp with P; that is, word order would be split intransitive as well. Examples such as (<!--\ref{ware1}-->a) and (<!--\ref{ware1}-->c) seem to contradict this, but maybe these are cases of marked word order. In any way, without significantly more text samples, it is hard to tell how exactly word order behaves in terms of alignment.

Warekena has a mixed pivot: some constructions are sensitive to the S/A alignment, while others operate in terms of S and P. Equi-NP deletion in coordinated clauses is an example of the former:[^pivot-1-2]
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{ware-equi-1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[235]{aikhenvald98}
\gll enami eda waʃi paɺa-mia
     man perceive jaguar run-PERF
\glt `A man saw a jaguar and the jaguar ran.'
\glend
\item \citet[236]{aikhenvald98}
\gll enami eda-hã waʃi paɺa-mia enami 
     man perceive-PAUS jaguar run-PERF man
\glt `A man saw a jaguar and ran.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{ware-equi-2} \citet[236]{aikhenvald98}
\gll wa ma-kaɺe-mia-hã ema waʃi mutʃita-mia-hã
     then NEG-breath-PERF-PAUS tapir jaguar bite-PERF-PAUS
\glt `Then the tapir grew tired, and the jaguar bit him.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^pivot-1-2]: Notice that there are no pivot restrictions for first and second persons, since they are always obligatorily marked.

Example (<!--\ref{ware-equi-1}-->a) illustrates that the ellipsed S constituent in the second clause (the argument of the verb 'to run') is coreferential with the P argument of the first, while (<!--\ref{ware-equi-1}-->b) shows that the A argument cannot be ellipsed in the same way. In (<!--\ref{ware-equi-2}-->) we can see that Sp behaves the same as Sa in terms of pivot restrictions; thus there is no split intransitive pattern apparent in Equi-NP deletion.[^breathless]

However, in presence of the presentative conjunction *wa(-hã)*, Equi-NP deletion seems to operate with respect to an S/A pivot instead. In the following example, the third person non-feminine singular S argument from the first clause is maintained as an A argument throughout:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[237]{aikhenvald98}
\gll wa-hã ʃa wa neta-hã peya neyawa i-ʃumiawa wa: apiñaya-yu pane-waba
     then-PAUS go then ask-PAUS one woman 3SG.F-wife+FEM then bring-3SG.F house-DIR
\glt `Then he went, then he asked another woman to be his wife, then he brought her home.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^breathless]: It may not be readily apparent, but *ma-kaɺe*, 'breathless, tired from work/running', is listed as an Sp verb (p. 362), and seems to be an example of a verb formed from a nominal root.

Other types of constructions that are sensitive to an S/A pivot include certain types of subordinate clauses, e.g. locative clauses:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[282]{aikhenvald98}
\gll kuɺimaɺu nupa-mia-wa waɺi yutsia ema
     turtle arrive-PERF-NONACC where kill tapir
\glt `Turtle arrived to where he killed the tapir.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

All in all, pivots in Warekena seem to be rather complex, but there seems to be no evidence that they exhibit an Sa/Sp split along the lines that verbal affixes (and maybe word order) do.

### Garifuna
[#munro07] blahblah!

### Kurripako
In Kurripako [#baure-kurri], another North Arawak language spoken around the borders of Venezuela, Columbia and Brazil, A arguments are marked as prefixes on the verb, while P arguments are expressed post-verbally via independent pronouns (or full noun phrases). The exception are third person P arguments for which suffixes still exist:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{kurri-trans} \citet[399]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-heema kalaka
     1SG-barbecue chicken
\glt `I barbecue the chicken.'
\glend
\item
\gll nu-heema srua
     1SG-barbecue 3SG.F
\glt `I barbecue it.'
\glend
\item
\gll nu-heema-no
     1SG-barbecue-3SG.F
\glt `I barbecue it.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

(<!--\ref{kurri-trans}-->) provides three transitive verb constructions describing the same situation, using a full noun phrase, an independent pronoun and a pronominal suffix respectively; notice how the pronoun and the suffix seemingly have no resemblance to each other.

The full table of pronominal affixes is given below; unfortunately <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> don't provide a similar table for the independent pronouns.

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||
|     | A prefixes    | P suffixes  | A prefixes  | P suffixes  |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1   | nu-           |             | wa-         |             |
| 2   | pi-           |             | i-          |             |
| 3M  | li-           | -ni         | na-         | -na         |
| 3F  | ru-           | -no         | na-         | -na         |
| 3FOC| i-            |             | na-         |             |
[Cross-referencing verbal affixes in Kurripako]

Even though the prefix/suffix opposition is largely lost in Kurripako, the language still works in split intransitive terms the same as Warekena, as shown by the following examples:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[398]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nu-dia-ka-wa panti-liku
     1SG-return-PROG-INTR house-LOC
\glt `I am returning into the house.'
\glend
\item
\gll haamaa-ka hnua
     tired-PROG 1SG
\glt `I am tired.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Verbs such as 'return' are Sa verbs in Kurripako, while a property verb like 'be tired' is an Sp verb, much as it was the case in Warekena; the only difference is that Sp verbs are not marked by suffixes but via independent pronouns.[^kurri-3]

The example of Kurripako shows that while in many Arawak languages the split intransitive pattern is based on a prefix/suffix opposition, this opposition remains present even after the (partial) loss of suffixes; it seems as if a new pattern, involving independent pronouns, was created to fill the gap thus created.

[^kurri-3]: Unfortunately, with the few examples provided it is not possible to decide, but it stands to reason that third person Sp arguments could be marked via suffixes the same as the P argument in (<!--\ref{kurri-trans}-->c).

It has additionally to be noted about Kurripako that Aikhenvald (??) considers it to be same language as Baniwa of Içana, which is described as a fluid-S language by [81][#dixon94;]. The descriptions however do not seem quite to match: According to Dixon, Baniwa of Içana uses a prefix vs. suffix system not unlike Warekena; additionally "die" is described as an example of an Sp verb. It is hard to see how such a discrepancy came to be, especially since Dixon explicitly cites Aikhenvald as a source of personal communication.[^baniwa-taylor] Maybe the two languages are distinct after all or maybe the different authors chose to describe different varieties; maybe it is simply the quality of the data that is at fault. In any case, situations like this one illustrate the challenges associated with a comparative study of languages that are so poorly described as the Amazonian ones are.

[^baniwa-taylor]: I could, unfortunately, not get my hands on the other reference Dixon cites, a 1991 grammar written in Portuguese[see the reference in\]\[81][#dixon94].

### Baure
[#baure-kurri;] contrast Kurripako with Baure, a South Arawak language spoken in Bolivia near the border to Brazil. Superficially the two are quite distinct: Baure has retained the prefix/suffix opposition (although they are analysed as clitics by <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}-->.) as can be seen in (<!--\ref{baure-trans}-->a), which also shows the use of an overt independent pronoun (used for emphasis) that however does not replace the personal proclitic. (<!--\ref{baure-trans}-->b) shows that the P enclitic is dropped in the presence of an overt NP:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-trans} \citet[401]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll nti' ni=komorik p-a-š simori
     1SG 1SG=kill one-CLF:animal pig
\glt `I killed one pig.'
\glend
\item
\gll heni, ver ni=komorikie=ro
     yes PVF 1SG=kill=3SG.M
\glt `Yes, I already killed it.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

The full set of agreement clitics is given in the following table:

|     | sg                         || pl                        ||
|     | A prefixes    | P suffixes  | A prefixes  | P suffixes  |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1   | ni-           | -ni         | vi-         | -vi         |
| 2   | pi-           | -pi         | yi-         | -yi         |
| 3M  | ro-           | -ro         | no-         | -no         |
| 3F  | ri-           | -ri         | no-         | -no         |
[Cross-referencing verbal clitics in Baure]

<!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> argue that the split intransitive pattern in Baure is quite distinct from the one in Kurripako. While the Sa marking in (<!--\ref{baure-sa}-->) is consistent with Kurripako, the examples in (<!--\ref{baure-non-sp}-->) would be Sp verbs in Kurripako, but are marked with proclitics in Baure:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-sa} \citet[400]{baure-kurri}
\gll vi=šim ač vi=kowyo-po ač vi=imok
     1PL=arrive and 1PL=bathe-PRFLX and 1PL=sleep
\glt `We arrive, we take a bath (bathe ourselves), and we sleep.'
\glend
\item\label{baure-non-sp}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \citet[401]{baure-kurri}
\gll vi=ha'ino-wo
     1PL-tired-COP
\glt `We are tired.'
\glend
\item \citet[402]{baure-kurri}
\gll ni=mane-wapa
     1SG=cold-COS
\glt `I am cold/I got cold.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

The argument goes that the split is not between stative and dynamic verbs, as they analyse Kurripako,[^kurripako-stative] but between verbal and nonverbal predicates. This is illustrated by the following examples of Sp verbs:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{baure-sp} \citet[402]{baure-kurri}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll monči-wo=ni
     child-COP=1SG
\glt `I was a child.'
\glend
\item
\gll mehewkon-wape=ro
     bad-COS=3SG.M
\glt `It is bad.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

This seeems like a contrived argument to me, however. Distinctions between verbs and other word classes, especially adjectives, are not obvious in many languages if they exist at all, and, as mentioned before, [#aikhenvald98;] explicitly states that their boundaries are fuzzy in Warekena. From the examples provided it might seem as if Baure has a more explicit distinction since nonverbal roots appear either with a copular or with a "change of state" suffix, but then how does that explain the presence of the suffix both on Sa verbs (<!--\ref{baure-non-sp}-->) and Sp verbs (<!--\ref{baure-sp}-->)? I fail to see a principled difference between 'cold', 'tired' and 'bad' and why the former two could be called examples of stative verbs and the latter an adjective. In any case, <!--\citeauthor{baure-kurri}--> do not discuss this issue. It is therefore hard to understand what the split in argument marking really consists of. It may be that the split intransitive pattern in Baure is retreating and that the proclitic marking is being generalised, such that more and more former Sp verbs are used as Sa verbs, but without more examples it is hard to tell; the split in Baure appears therefore to be quite idiosyncratic in nature (although this only concerns property verbs; non-property verbs are always Sa verbs as in other Arawak languages).

[^kurripako-stative]: I also question that the pattern in Kurripako can be analysed as a distinction between stative and dynamic verbs, but I will come back to this question WHERE?

### Tariana
lalala?

write something about glosses and how i changed them but kept spelling original...

ALTHOUGH IN WAREKENA, WHICH MAY BE A TYPICAL EXAMPLE AND VERY WELL REFLECT THE SITUATION IN PROTO-ARAWAK, SPLIT INTRANSITIVITY IS MANIFEST VIA THE PREFIX/SUFFIX OPPOSITION, THE TWO MAY EVOLVE INDEPENDENTLY: IN KURRIPAKO, THE SPLIT IS KEPT ALTHOUGH THE SUFFIXES ARE LARGELY LOST; ON THE OTHER HAND, GARIFUNA KEEPS THIS OPPOSITION EVEN THOUGH THE SPLIT INTRANSITIVE PATTERN IS ABSENT.
