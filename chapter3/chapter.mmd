# A survey of Arawak languages

## The Arawak languages
Write loads of stuff about the situation in the Amazon, the Arawak languages etc. etc. This is all Aikhenvald, maybe some Campbell.

## Case studies

### The data
In order to get an overview over the phenomenon of split intransitivity in Arawak, I collected data from ?? languages, from sources such as grammars, articles and text collections. Of course, most Amazonian languages are poorly, if at all, documented; I couldn't, therefore, be particulary selective about the languages surveyed and had to consider what was readily available. No particular work has been dedicated to ensure the representativeness and balance of the sample, neither in terms of areal distribution, nor of linguistic subgroups within Arawak---which, as previously discussed, are a matter of debate anyway. This, as well as the relatively small size of the sample, and the limited reliability of the sources considered, indicate that the analyses carried out can be exploratory in nature at best, and that in order to get to more meaningful results, more work would have to devoted than is possible in this thesis.

I encountered several difficulties with the data, including the following:

- As confusing as the linguistic situation in the Amazon is, nomenclature does nothing to help. There are a lot of instances where the same name is used for quite unrelated languages, such as Baniwa ?? (ref?), or the two probably unrelated languages, one now extinct, that are called Warekena (see section ??)---problems that arise when either very general endonyms or exonyms are used, or when the cultural identity of a group is mistaken with its linguistic one; the converse problem, where multiple names are used to refer to the same language, arises with Garifuna (see section ??), and it seems unclear whether these really indicate the same language or maybe slightly different variants. More generally, we have to assume both historical and dialectal variation in languages, and as soon any language is being described by more than one source, there is no guarantee that the same variety is being considered after all.
- Arawak languages seem to be generally head-marking, but there is quite a deal of variation as to how obligatory cross-referencing affixes really are. Many languages allow particularly the ellipsis of third person affixes, which may complicate the analysis further.
- I touched on the issue of the defition of verbs briefly in the previous chapter (did I??). When we find (as we will below) that in Arawak languages, patientive intransitive verbs are really property "verbs", not only does this beg the question as to the definition of word classes, but it also means that sources can not be relied upon too much, especially when they mention adjectives as a word class as well. (On this I should elaborate more)
- Of course, the sources themselves are of varying quality; even assuming that the data they recorded is correct, not all of them provide glossed examples, translational equivalents may not be exact, allomorphy may pose analytical problems, they sometimes contradict themselves (Aikhenvald: Bare?) and they sometimes operate in frameworks such as tagmemics that are not easily accessible as of today.

6? of the languages considered I will describe in detail in the sections that follow. I chose languages that are as different from each other as possible, in terms of geography or contact situation, assuming that this would lead to the most variation in the domain of alignment systems as well. Warekena (??) illustrates split intransitivity similar as to how it is found in a lot of other Arawak languages. Tariana (??) is interesting, as it is one of the only Arawak languages with a case system, maybe owing to its long history of contact to Tucanoan languages. Garifuna (??) is the only Arawak language spoken outside South America and has had a very complex history of contact with a number of languages, including Carib and European languages. Amuesha (??) is spoken at the Southern borders of the Amazon region and clearly shows the influence of Andean languages, such as Quechua and Aymara. More?? The remaining ?? languages will be considered more summarily. Table ?? lists some key properties of each language surveyed and also includes the sources consulted.

Levenshtein blahblah?
