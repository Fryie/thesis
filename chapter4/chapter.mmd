# Conclusions
In this thesis, I have examined the split intransitive alignment patterns in nine Arawak languages. To do so, I first attempted in chapter <!--\ref{theory}--> to establish a rigourous and empirical approach to the study of alignment systems in general and split intransitivity in particular. I discussed several theoretical issues, such as how we might define S, A and P; how these primitives relate to split intransitivity; what semantic properties serve to classify intransitive verbs in a split intransitive language; the fact that alignment systems are construction-specific; or whether split intransitivity in supposedly "active-stative" languages really depends on lexical aspect rather than on the distinction between descriptive and non-descriptive verbs. Some questions I had to leave unanswered: for example, how to distinguish between verbs and other word classes; or whether oblique S arguments should be treated as an instance of split intransitivity. That these problems are not generally addressed by typologists working on split intransitive languages could be observed in chapter <!--\ref{empirical}-->, where I carried out my analysis of the Arawak languages as they were presented in grammars, text collections and articles; even if authors were aware of split intransitivity the discussion was often sketchy and did not draw attention to important details. The analysis itself did reveal some interesting conclusions, such as the relative stability of split intransitivity in Arawak or (possibly) the two different types of split systems in Tariana, but it also left many issues unresolved.

A more empirical study of split intransitivity in Arawak languages would have to draw on considerably more (and more reliable) source material. It could answer a number of important questions more properly, for example: How many languages have kept the split marking pattern? How frequent are splits in other types of constructions---such as word order or constraints on pivots? What is the influence of neighbouring language families or linguistic areas---e.g. Tucano languages for Tariana, Andean languages for Amuesha, Carib languages for Garifuna---on morphosyntactic alignment? Is the semantic basis of split intransitivity the same for all or most Arawak languages, i.e. the descriptive vs. non-descriptive distinction---and if not, what other categorisations can be found and how did they evolve?

Given the incredible structural diversity of South American languages and the fact that many of them are severely threatened with extinction, I think it is fundamental that systematic, rigourous and empirical research be carried out in this area before we lose a substantial amount of data about what languages might look like.
