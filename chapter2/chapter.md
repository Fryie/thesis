# Towards a theory of split intransitivity
Blahblah

## A preliminary definition
Basically, [#dixon94;] ([#comrie78;]?).

## Issues??
Talk about tertium comparationis [see for example\]\[][#cysouw07,haspelmath07,haspelmath10a,lazard02].

There are a couple of issues and problems with our definition of split intransitivity thus far. They include:

1. Grammatical relations are specific to constructions, not clauses [#bickel10].
2. Transitivity is not a binary category [others??\]\[][#lazard02].
3. Are S, A and P really comparative concepts? [#mithun99].
4. Different definitions of S, A and P [#haspelmath11].
5. comparative concept or descriptive category?

Let's discuss those in turn.

Dixon's definition is problematic because: it assumes a) that transitive-intransitive is a binary distinction, b) that there is one type of transitive clause with uniform assignment to A and P --- but both are not true. We should therefore separate what stays the same (prototypical transitive, intransitive) from what changes (all possible shades of variations of non-canonical constructions that can vary almost infinitely from language to language).

Basically, I want to use Lazard's definition of transitivity (see also Comrie, and the discussion of different notions in [#haspelmath11;]), major biactant construction, to define A and P, and find a comparable definition for prototypical intransitive clause (maybe just: construction with a sole argument) -> S. Then find languages where S is not uniformly encoded, in particular, where it is sometimes encoded as A and sometimes as P. (What happens in Arawak?) I also propose: *systematic* variance (in order to exclude occasional quirky cases as in "Mich friert").

Highlight also the arbitrariness of comparative concepts: are they useful or not? While Dixon's S, A and O lack clear theoretical status e.g. w.r.t. non-canonical sentences, Bickel's concepts are well-defined --- but are they useful? This is an *a posteriori* question, in this thesis I am going to employ the Lazard definition. However, Bickel's observation that alignment cannot be defined on per-clause-basis but on per-construction-basis, is important (and does this apply to e.g. English past participles?).

blah[^note]

[^note]: In practice, however, it can be hard (or even impossible) to exactly tell when two constructions are the same, and when they are different. [where?][#croft01;] notes this when he says that "there's no end to splitting" (exact quote?).
