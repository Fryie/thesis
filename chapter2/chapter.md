# Towards a theory of split intransitivity
Blahblah

## A preliminary definition
Owing to ancient Greek and Latin tradition, work on grammatical relations (that is, on the way verbal arguments are encoded) used to be based on the terms "subject" and "object". It became however clear, when studying languages that did things differently than most European languages, that those notions were not truly amenable to cross-linguistic comparisons, since they denote bundles of properties that do not need to coincide in many languages, instead of true syntactic primitives. Starting with the work on *ergativity*, such as [#comrie78;] or [#dixon94;], the terms S, A and P as more general alternative have become increasingly established[for a history of the terms see\]\[??--??][#haspelmath11].[^o-vs-p]

### S, A and P
The definition of S, A and P relies on the assumption that every language makes a basic distinction between *transitive* and *intransitive* clauses (something that shall be challenged later on). The intransitive clause contains a single argument and it is that which we identify as S. 

[^o-vs-p]: Dixon (and others) actually uses O instead of P, but this is a mere notational variant. I prefer to use P, because it reminiscent of the semantic notion of *patient*, instead of the cross-linguistically less applicable term *object*. 

### Nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems

According to the *World Atlas of Linguistic Structures*, about ?? of the worlds languages are ... and ?? ... (citation). There are other types; among them: split intransitivity.

### Construction-specificity of grammatical relations
Not all constructions have to align S, A and P in the same way. This is most radically formulated by [??][#bickel10;]: "??", but has been recognized before. Blahblah syntactic vs. morphological---pivots---examples 

## Issues??
Talk about tertium comparationis [see for example\]\[][#cysouw07,haspelmath07,haspelmath10a,lazard02].

There are a couple of issues and problems with our definition of split intransitivity thus far. They include:

1. Grammatical relations are specific to constructions, not clauses [#bickel10]. THIS SHOULD BE IN THE PRECEDING SECTION W. EX.
2. Transitivity is not a binary category [others??\]\[][#lazard02].
3. Are S, A and P really comparative concepts? [#mithun99].
4. Different definitions of S, A and P [#haspelmath11].
5. comparative concept or descriptive category?

Let's discuss those in turn.

Dixon's definition is problematic because: it assumes a) that transitive-intransitive is a binary distinction, b) that there is one type of transitive clause with uniform assignment to A and P---but both are not true. We should therefore separate what stays the same (prototypical transitive, intransitive) from what changes (all possible shades of variations of non-canonical constructions that can vary almost infinitely from language to language).

Basically, I want to use Lazard's definition of transitivity (see also Comrie, and the discussion of different notions in [#haspelmath11;]), major biactant construction, to define A and P, and find a comparable definition for prototypical intransitive clause (maybe just: construction with a sole argument) -> S. Then find languages where S is not uniformly encoded, in particular, where it is sometimes encoded as A and sometimes as P. (What happens in Arawak?) I also propose: *systematic* variance (in order to exclude occasional quirky cases as in "Mich friert").

Highlight also the arbitrariness of comparative concepts: are they useful or not? While Dixon's S, A and O lack clear theoretical status e.g. w.r.t. non-canonical sentences, Bickel's concepts are well-defined --- but are they useful? This is an *a posteriori* question, in this thesis I am going to employ the Lazard definition. However, Bickel's observation that alignment cannot be defined on per-clause-basis but on per-construction-basis, is important (and does this apply to e.g. English past participles?).

blah[^note]

[^note]: In practice, however, it can be hard (or even impossible) to exactly tell when two constructions are the same, and when they are different. [where?][#croft01;] notes this when he says that "there's no end to splitting" (exact quote?).
