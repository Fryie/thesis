# Towards a theory of split intransitivity
Blahblah

## A preliminary definition
Owing to ancient Greek and Latin tradition, work on grammatical relations (that is, on the way verbal arguments are encoded) used to be based on the terms "subject" and "object". It became however clear, when studying languages that did things differently than most European languages, that those notions were not truly amenable to cross-linguistic comparisons, since they denote bundles of properties that do not need to coincide in many languages, instead of true syntactic primitives. Starting with the work on *ergativity*, such as [#comrie78;] or [#dixon94;], the terms S, A and P as more general alternative have become increasingly established[for a history of the terms see\]\[??--??][#haspelmath11]

### S, A and P
As used by [6--8][#dixon94;] the terms S, A and P[^o-vs-p] are based on the observation that every language makes a basic distinction between *intransitive* verbs (having one argument) and *transitive* verbs (having two or more arguments). S is simply defined to be the single argument of the intransitive verb, while A and P map onto the transitive arguments---in the case of verbs with more than two arguments, only two of them will be identified as A and P.[^other-roles] The distinction between A and P is semantically based (unlike S, which is defined purely in syntactical terms) and Dixon notes how consistent different languages seem to be with respect to it; for 'hit' it is the hitter, for 'give' the giver, for 'speak' the speaker, etc., that will be assigned to A. Generally, "that role which is most likely to be relevant to the success of the activity will be identified as A" [8][#dixon94]. In two-argument constructions, the other argument will be O; but in constructions with more arguments, there seems to be no fixed rule as to which of the non-A arguments should be the O argument. A more accessible (if not particularly robust) definition would be:

> **A** refers to that argument of a transitive verb which would be its subject in a non-ergative language like English [<!--\ldots-->] and P refers to the argument that would be the direct object. [??][#comrie78]

In the intransitive sentence "I sleep", *I* would be the S argument, while in the transitive sentence "I hit the slave", *I* would be identified as A and *the slave* as P. Note that this is not a fact about English, but holds true for any language, regardless of the way arguments are actually encoded.

[^o-vs-p]: Dixon (as well as many others) actually uses O instead of P, but this is a mere notational variant. I prefer to use P, because it reminiscent of the semantic notion of *patient*, instead of the cross-linguistically less applicable term *object*.

[^other-roles]: Subsequently, linguists have adopted terms to specify those additional arguments as well, such as G for the goal argument (citations?).

### Nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems
The definition of arguments in terms of S, A and P serves as a theoretical framework in order to describe the way grammatical relations are expressed in particular languages. While it is conceivable that languages use specific devices (e.g. case) to distinguish S, A and P all from one another, one finds that this *tripartite* system is rarely used (citation). The reason for this is that, while it is necessary to distinguish the arguments of a transitive sentence, S does not need to be distinguished from anything, since it occurs by itself. Most languages, therefore, treat the S argument formally either like the A argument or like the P argument (this is also called *(morphosyntactic) alignment*, since the grammatical primitives are effectively aligned, i.e. formally equated, in one way or another). Languages that encode S like A are said to belong to the *nominative-accusative* type; the ones that encode S like P belong to the *ergative-absolutive* type.[^abbrev] In case-marking languages often the following traditional names are used:

|     |*Nominative-accusative*|*Ergative-absolutive* |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------------|
|**A**| nominative            |ergative              |
|**S**| nominative            |absolutive            |
|**P**| accusative            |absolutive            |
[Traditional names for grammatical cases]

For non-case-marking languages, there doesn't appear to be a standard terminology. For accusative languages, the terms "subject" and "object" have been used for the corresponding grammatical relations (not necessarily just case)---some linguists, like [??][#dixon94;], use the term "subject" more generally for any kind of ?? that aligns S with A, even in ergative languages.

The distinction between those two types of languages can be illustrated by comparing Latin (of the accusative type) with Dyirbal (of the absolutive type; both are case-marking languages):[^latin-dyirbal-exs]

As we see, Latin uses the same nominative ending *-us* for the S relation in <!--\ref{latin1}--> and the A relation in <!--\ref{latin2}-->, but a different ending, the accusative *-um*, for the P relation. By contrast, in Dyirbal the S in <!--\ref{dyirbal1}--> and the P in <!--\ref{dyirbal2}--> are both in the unmarked absolutive case, whereas the A argument appears with the ergative ending *-<!--\ng{}-->u*.

While Dyirbal and Latin both use case marking for the marking of arguments (and both have very flexible word order), ergativity or accusativity can show up in other kinds of marking as well; for example English has little morphology, but its accusative alignment can be seen (apart from the third person verbal agreement and pronominal case) by the fact that S and A generally come before the verb while P comes after in typical sentences. A case of ergativity manifest in word order (i.e. where S and P occupy the same position, as opposed to A) is unknown (or rare??; citation), but this is not an *a priori* necessity, simply an *a posteriori* fact about the distribution of alignment types.

[^latin-dyirbal-exs]: Examples are adapted from [9--10][#dixon94;].

[^abbrev]: The alignment types are often (and henceforth also in this thesis) abbreviated to just *accusative* and *ergative*.

### Construction-specificity of grammatical relations
Not all constructions have to align S, A and P in the same way. This is most radically formulated by [??][#bickel10;]: "??", but has been recognized before. Blahblah syntactic vs. morphological---pivots---examples 

### Split intransitivity
blahblah

It is not so easy to assess how frequent the different types are, especially as alignment can be dependant on the specific construction (see below). A rough estimate can be given by examining the distributions given in the *World Atlas of Linguistic Structure*, which, unfortunately, are split between pronominal, NP and verbal marking. Since many languages do not have one kind of marking or the other (e.g. many languages don't have any kind of (pro-)nominal case), it makes sense to calculate the ratio not only of an alignment type with respect to the whole sample, but also specifically with respect to the subsample that has any kind of such marking. [#wals-comrie,wals-siewierska]

|**Construction**  |**Nominative-accusative**|**Ergative-absolutive**|**Split intransitive**|
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
|*NP marking*      | 27% (52/190)            | 17% (32/190)          | 2% (4/190)           |
| -- of all marked | 57% (52/92)             | 35% (32/92)           | 4% (4/92)            |

|*Pronoun marking* | 37% (64/172)            | 12% (20/172)          | 2% (3/172)           |
| -- of all marked | 69% (64/93)             | 22% (20/93)           | 3% (3/93)            |

|*Verbal marking*  | 56% (212/380)           | 5% (19/380)           | 7% (26/380)          |
| -- of all marked | 72% (212/296)           | 6% (19/296)           | 9% (26/380)          |
[Distribution of alignment types acording to WALS]

Of course, such a distributional analysis is flawed, primarily because the data samples (even if they are chosen to be well-balanced by themselves, something that is notoriously difficult in typology, given the sparsity of data [see\]\[??][#bickel10]) are not the same for the three construction types. Nonetheless we may tentatively conclude that ...

## Issues??
Talk about tertium comparationis [see for example\]\[][#cysouw07,haspelmath07,haspelmath10a,lazard02].

There are a couple of issues and problems with our definition of split intransitivity thus far. They include:

1. Grammatical relations are specific to constructions, not clauses [#bickel10]. THIS SHOULD BE IN THE PRECEDING SECTION W. EX.
2. Transitivity is not a binary category [others??\]\[][#lazard02].
3. Are S, A and P really comparative concepts? [#mithun99].
4. Different definitions of S, A and P [#haspelmath11].
5. comparative concept or descriptive category?

Let's discuss those in turn.

Dixon's definition is problematic because: it assumes a) that transitive-intransitive is a binary distinction, b) that there is one type of transitive clause with uniform assignment to A and P---but both are not true. We should therefore separate what stays the same (prototypical transitive, intransitive) from what changes (all possible shades of variations of non-canonical constructions that can vary almost infinitely from language to language).

Basically, I want to use Lazard's definition of transitivity (see also Comrie, and the discussion of different notions in [#haspelmath11;]), major biactant construction, to define A and P, and find a comparable definition for prototypical intransitive clause (maybe just: construction with a sole argument) -> S. Then find languages where S is not uniformly encoded, in particular, where it is sometimes encoded as A and sometimes as P. (What happens in Arawak?) I also propose: *systematic* variance (in order to exclude occasional quirky cases as in "Mich friert").

Highlight also the arbitrariness of comparative concepts: are they useful or not? While Dixon's S, A and O lack clear theoretical status e.g. w.r.t. non-canonical sentences, Bickel's concepts are well-defined --- but are they useful? This is an *a posteriori* question, in this thesis I am going to employ the Lazard definition. However, Bickel's observation that alignment cannot be defined on per-clause-basis but on per-construction-basis, is important (and does this apply to e.g. English past participles?).

blah[^note]

[^note]: In practice, however, it can be hard (or even impossible) to exactly tell when two constructions are the same, and when they are different. [where?][#croft01;] notes this when he says that "there's no end to splitting" (exact quote?).
