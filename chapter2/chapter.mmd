# Towards a theory of split intransitivity [theory]
Although split intransitivity has been studied for some time (see <!--\citealt{wichmann}--> for a history), I feel that to this date there is no adequate theoretical foundation for the pattern---contributions such as [#donohue08;] notwithstanding. I will first introduce split intransitivity in section <!--\ref{preliminary}--> as it is most commonly understood by linguists today, using the three semantic primitives S, A and P. Unfortunately these are not unproblematic and often not rigourously defined by many scholars working on split intransitivity, which may lead to a number of subtle (but important) problems. Building upon work of [#haspelmath11;] and [#lazard02;], I will then in section <!--\ref{rigour}--> attempt to develop a solid and more empirically grounded approach to S, A and P, and subsequently to split intransitivity.

## A preliminary definition [preliminary]
*Grammatical relations* is the term generally used to refer to morphosyntactic properties of verbal arguments to specific constructions (see e.g. <!--\citealt{bickel10}--> for a general introduction to the subject---although my approach to grammatical relations will be somewhat different, as discussed in section <!--\ref{rigour}-->). Traditionally, grammatical relations have been described in terms of the notions of "subject" and "object". For the analysis of most (Indo-)European languages, this has turned out to be unproblematic, which doubtless led to the assumption that those concepts would be applicable to more exotic languages as well. Languages such as Basque (spoken in Europe, but not Indo-European) or Dyirbal (an Australian aboriginal language of the Pama-Nyungan family) however challenge those notions as they question the unity of the transitive and the intransitive subject; for that reason the terms are not truly amenable to cross-linguistic comparisons (or at least not unless defined more precisely). Linguists working on *ergativity*, such as [#comrie78;] or [#dixon94;], have introduced the terms S, A and P as a more general alternative and these have subsequently become widely established [for a history of the terms see\]\[539--542][#haspelmath11]. I will introduce these terms now, as they will serve as the background for the study of split intransitivity. As mentioned before, I will revisit S, A and P more critically in section <!--\ref{rigour}-->.

### S, A and P
The terms S, A and P are intended as *semantic primitives*, basic building blocks specifically designed for cross-linguistic comparison, with the goal of being more generally applicable than "subject" or "object". The introduction in this section is largely based on [6--8][#dixon94;],[^o-vs-p] although other linguists have used these terms in similar ways. The basic observation is that every language makes a fundamental distinction between *intransitive* verbs with only one argument (such as *go*, *sleep*, *die* or *sneeze*) and *transitive* verbs with two arguments (such as *kill*, *cut*, *open* or *draw*). The single argument of the intransitive clause is referred to by the label S, a definition that is purely syntactical. By contrast, the two arguments of the transitive clause, A and P, are distinguished on semantic grounds. According to [8][#dixon94;], "that role which is most likely to be relevant to the success of the activity will be identified as A". Dixon notes how consistent different languages seem to be with respect to this assignment; for 'hit' it is the hitter, for 'kill' the killer, for 'speak' the speaker, etc., that will be identified as A. This is even true for constructions with more than two arguments (*ditransitive* verbs, accordingly a subclass of transitive verbs), with the giver of 'give' generally being A as well. In two-argument constructions, the P role defaults to the only other argument; but in constructions with more arguments, there seems to be no fixed rule as to which of the non-A arguments should be the P argument.[^other-roles] Notice again the complex nature of the definition: S is syntactically determined, while A and P are identified partly on syntactic grounds (by virtue of being the two, or two out of several, arguments of a transitive verb) and partly on semantic grounds (with the semantic relationship of the arguments to the verb serving as the means to distinguish A from P).

Another way of defining A and P---not particulary robust and formal, but more intuitive and in the end more or less equivalent---is the following one:

> A refers to that argument of a transitive verb which would be its subject in a non-ergative language like English [<!--\ldots-->] and P refers to the argument that would be the direct object. [330--331][#comrie78]

The following English sentences serve to illustrate the three semantic primitives:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll I sleep.
     S
\glt
\glend
\item
\gll I hit the slave.
     A {} {} P
\glt
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Notice that this is not a fact about English; in other languages, arguments would be assigned to the primitives in the same way, even though the actual encoding may be very different to English.

[^o-vs-p]: Dixon (as well as many others) actually uses O instead of P, but this is a mere notational variant. I prefer to use P, because it is reminiscent of the semantic notion of *patient*, instead of the cross-linguistically less applicable term *object*.

[^other-roles]: Subsequently, linguists have adopted terms to refer to those additional arguments as well, such as G for the goal argument [see e.g.\]\[][#haspelmath11].

With S, A and P established as labels for cross-linguistic comparison we may now turn to the question how different languages behave in terms of them; as it turns out, there are some very important differences.

### Nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems
The definition of arguments in terms of S, A and P serves as a theoretical framework in order to describe the way grammatical relations are expressed in particular languages. While it is conceivable that languages use specific devices (e.g. case marking) to distinguish S, A and P all from one another, one finds that this *tripartite* system is rarely used [40][#dixon94]. The probable reason for this is that, while it is necessary to distinguish the arguments of a transitive sentence, S does not need to be distinguished from anything, since it occurs by itself. Therefore, most languages treat the S argument formally either like the A argument or like the P argument. The way different semantic primitives are encoded similarly or differently from each other is called *(morphosyntactic) alignment*, since some of them are effectively being "aligned," i.e. formally equated, in one way or another. Languages that encode S like A are said to belong to the *nominative-accusative* type---English is one such language; the ones that encode S like P belong to the *ergative-absolutive* type.[^abbrev] In case-marking languages often the following traditional names are used for the marking categories:

|     |*Nominative-accusative*|*Ergative-absolutive* |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------------|
|**A**| nominative            |ergative              |
|**S**| nominative            |absolutive            |
|**P**| accusative            |absolutive            |
[Traditional names for grammatical cases]

For accusative languages, there is often a terminological distinction between "nominative" and "accusative," which are used for nominal case, and the terms "subject" and "object" for the corresponding grammatical relations, irrespective of marking---although some linguists, such as [111--142][#dixon94;] or [404][#bickel10;], use labels like "subject" whenever there is some kind of common behaviour in S and A constituents even in non-accusative languages (Dixon mentions imperative constructions as an example). A similar distinction does not seem to exist for ergative languages.

The distinction between those two types of languages can be illustrated by comparing Latin (of the accusative type) with Dyirbal (of the ergative type); both are case-marking languages:[^latin-dyirbal-exs]

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \emph{Latin}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\glll domin-us veni-t
      master-NOM come-3SG
      S
\glt `The master comes.'
\glend
\item
\glll domin-us serv-um audi-t
      master-NOM slave-ACC hear-3SG
      A P
\glt `The master hears the slave.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Dyirbal}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\glll ŋuma banaga-n\textsuperscript{y}u
      father.ABS return-NONFUT
      S
\glt `Father returned.'
\glend
\item
\glll yabu ŋuma-ŋu bura-n
      mother.ABS father-ERG see-NONFUT
      P A
\glt `Father saw mother.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

As we see, Latin uses the same nominative ending *-us* for the S relation and the A relation, but a different ending, the accusative *-um*, for the P relation. By contrast, in Dyirbal S and P are both in the unmarked absolutive case, whereas the A argument appears with the ergative ending *-ŋu*.

[^latin-dyirbal-exs]: Examples are adapted from [9--10][#dixon94;].

[^abbrev]: The alignment types are often (and henceforth also in the present thesis) abbreviated to just *accusative* and *ergative*.

### Split intransitivity [split]
While accusative and ergative systems encode S uniformly in the same way as either A or P, in a number of languages this is not the case. Instead, S is sometimes marked as A and sometimes as P, depending on the semantics of the verb. A well-known example is Lakhota (see also the examples in section <!--\ref{intro}-->):[^lakhota2]

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{lakhota-trans} Lakhota transitive verbs \citep[514]{mithun91}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\gll Ø-wa-ktékte
     3SG.P-1SG.A-kill
\glt `I'll kill him.'
\glend
\item
\gll ma-Ø-ktékte
     1SG.P-3SG.A-kill
\glt `He'll kill me.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{lakhota-itr} Lakhota intransitive verbs \citep[515]{mithun91}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll wa-núwe
     1SG.A-swim
\glt `I swam.'
\glend
\item
\gll ma-t'é
     1SG.P-die
\glt `I died.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Lakhota uses different prefixes for A and P arguments, as seen by the use of the first person markers *wa-* for A (<!--\ref{lakhota-trans}-->a) and *ma-* for P (<!--\ref{lakhota-trans}-->b). Intransitive verbs may however take either set of prefixes, A (<!--\ref{lakhota-itr}-->a) or P (<!--\ref{lakhota-itr}-->b). The crucial difference between the two intransitive verbs is that 'swim' is a volitional and controlled activity, while 'die' refers to something that happens to a person (generally) without their active involvement. In Lakhota, verbs that are similar to 'swim' take on A prefixes and verbs similar to 'die' P prefixes. Languages in which S arguments may be marked either as A or as P and in which this decision is based on the semantics of the verb (or pragmatics of the utterance, see below), are called *split intransitive* (*split-S* in Dixon's terminology), since the class of intransitive verbs is split into two subclasses with different alignment.[^not-the-only] Similar to [#dixon94;], I will use the terms SA verbs and SP verbs for the classes of verbs in split intransitive languages whose arguments are marked like A and P respectively.

[^lakhota2]: Again, the examples were not glossed in the original source. I included an overt representation for the unmarked third person argument to make the examples clearer.

[^not-the-only]: Accusative, ergative and split intransitive alignment are not the only alignment systems, as there are some other less frequent ones such as *direct-inverse* or the aforementioned tripartite system.

Not all split intransitive languages are like Lakhota. On the one hand, [70--83][#dixon94;] distinguishes between *split-S* and *fluid-S* languages: While in the former type the choice of marking is fixed for each verb, according to its *prototypical* semantics, the latter allows SA and SP marking for the same verb, depending on the *situational* pragmatics; in such a language it may be possible, for example, to indicate the volitionality or degree of control that a participant possesses with respect to a particular event. Unfortunately, Dixon includes no clear examples of such languages. He mentions an Arawak language, Baniwa do Içana, that apparently exhibits this pattern; I will discuss this fact about Baniwa do Içana, in section <!--\ref{kurripako}-->, where I found no clear indication of a fluid nature of the split. More convincing examples appear in [#mithun91;], even though the term fluid-S is not used: In Guaraní, some verbs may appear with either A or P marking; however this seems to indicate a shift in semantics rather than pragmatics (e.g. *mimí* translates to 'shine' when marked with A, but to 'be brilliant' when marked with P). More to the point might be Central Pomo; SP marking is apparently always optional and only chosen if the speaker wants to highlight the affectedness of the participant.

Languages may also differ in the exact semantic criteria that decide whether a verb is going to be treated as an SA or an SP verb, as [#mithun91;] shows.[^arkadiev] In Lakhota this classification is sensitive to agentivity. Agent-like participants are marked with A prefixes and patient-like ones with P:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{lakhota3a} Lakhota SA verbs \citep[515]{mithun91}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll wa-škáte
     1SG.A-play
\glt `I'm playing.'
\glend
\item
\gll wa-pšá
     1SG.A-sneeze
\glt `I sneezed.'
\glend
\item
\gll wa-xpaye
     1SG.A-lie
\glt `I'm lying.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{lakhota3b} Lakhota SP verbs \citep[515-516]{mithun91}

\item

     1SG.P-die
\glt `I fainted, died.'
\glend
\item
\gll ma-sláte
     1SG.P-slow
\glt `I'm slow.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

[^arkadiev]: For a similar, but more formalist argument see [#arkadiev08;].

Agentivity is not an atomic concept; when characteristics of agency contradict, Lakhota treats performers or instigators of an action like agents, even when they possess no control over the action itself, as in (<!--\ref{lakhota3a}-->b). 

In Guaraní, the semantic basis for split intransitivity is different. There are many verbs whose S arguments are not performers, nor do they have control over the action, yet are SA verbs, such as *manó*, 'die' or *kašá*, 'stagger'. Mithun claims that split intransivity in Guaraní is sensitive to lexical aspect, in the sense that state verbs belong to the SP class. However, I'm not convinced of this analysis. Almost all of the examples of SP verbs she cites (e.g. *aimé*, 'be sharp', *aranú*, 'be wise', *karapé*, 'be short') are translated into English with the use of adjectives (and Mithun even explicitly states that adjectives borrowed from Spanish are generally treated as SP verbs in Guaraní). This indicates that they refer to (temporary or permanent) physical, emotional or mental properties of the participant. By contrast, a stative verb like *ké*, 'sleep,' is listed as an SA verb. While the distinction between properties and other states may not in all cases be clear (and while a more rigorous study of lexical aspect and other semantic characteristics of verbs is outside the scope of the present thesis), I maintain that it is still an important one. With the limited data presented here, it is not possible to provide a more precise analysis of whether SP verbs in Guaraní are really state verbs or rather property-denoting verbs, but, as will be shown in chapter <!--\ref{empirical}-->, in Arawak languages it is generally the latter aspect that is relevant for the categorisation of intransitive verbs. In what follows, I will use the term *descriptive verb* to refer to that kind of verbs which usually translates to adjectives in English.[^descriptive-where]

[^descriptive-where]: I don't know where the term originated, but it is used e.g. by [#facundes00;] in his grammar of Apurinã.

A more complex system is found in Central Pomo; I already mentioned that SP marking is optional. Additionally, it can only be applied to participants who are both out of control (sneezers are SP arguments in Central Pomo, unlike in Lakhota) and significantly affected; split intransitivity is therefore sensitive to the interplay between two different semantic properties of verbs.

Mithun also notes that there are often some irregular and non-predictable patterns in split intransitive languages, due to factors such as grammaticalisation, lexicalisation or analogy. For example, the Guaraní verb *esaví*, 'wink', is an SP verb, since it literally means 'to have defective eyes'. Similarly, in Lakhota, <!--\emph{ha\textbf{wá}gluxpu}-->, 'I am scabbed,' is an SA instead of an SP verb, probably because it originally meant "pick off one's own skin". These examples highlight the fact that, as all patterns in language, alignment systems must also be partially understood in terms of their historical development.

Notice that there is a set of verbs which are expected to be treated in the same way in all languages with split intransitivity. Event verbs whose argument is in control of and performing the action are SA verbs uniformly across languages; similarly if a language has descriptive verbs (as opposed to using non-verbal constructions such as adjectives for properties of participants), it is likely that these will be SP verbs. These sets of verbs where agentivity, lexical aspect and being a property coincide connect all those different semantic bases and it is quite likely that it is from these verbs that the more refined and complex marking systems in individual languages arose, by focusing on either one or the other aspect of the verbal semantics.

It is important to distinguish split intransitivity from a related type of 'split' alignment system, which shows up in a number of languages, as noted for example by [350--355][#comrie78;] or [83--110][#dixon94;]. In Dyirbal, first and second person pronouns are accusatively marked, as opposed to third person pronouns and full NPs. In Georgian, only aorist tense clauses display ergative alignment, whereas in the present tense, arguments are accusatively marked. These splits that are conditioned by properties of the clause or of the arguments, instead of verbal semantics (or pragmatics) are generally not considered to be instances of split intransitivity; they are commonly referred to as *split ergativity*.

### Construction-specificity of grammatical relations [construction]
[336--350][#comrie78;] and [11--18,143--181][#dixon94;] already noted that it is necessary to distinguish between *morphological* and *syntactic* ergativity. While the former term refers to the actual encoding of arguments, the latter is concerned with constraints on different grammatical constructions and how they operate in terms of grammatical relations. A language is said to be syntactically ergative if constructions such as coordination, relativisation or raising are sensitive to an S/P vs. A distinction; typically it will then treat the S/P argument preferentially and is said to have an S/P or absolutive *pivot*. Syntactic ergativity is exhibited for example in Dyirbal:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \label{dyirbal-syntactic} \citet[12]{dixon94}
\glll 	ŋuma banaga-n\textsuperscript{y}u yabu-ŋgu buran
	father.ABS return-NONFUT mother-ERG see-NONFUT
	S {} A
\glt `Father returned and mother saw him.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

What appears missing in example (<!--\ref{dyirbal-syntactic}-->) is a translational equivalent of the third person masculine pronoun 'him'. But there is no need to specify that argument in Dyirbal---since 'father' is S in the first and P in the second clause (that is, an absolutive argument) it doesn't have to be repeated. Contrast that with an English sentence like "Father returned and saw mother". In this sentence, "father" is implicitly understood to be the A argument (the subject) of the second clause, since English operates under a *nominative* pivot. It would not be possible to construct such a sentence in Dyirbal with the same meaning, much as example (<!--\ref{dyirbal-syntactic}-->) would not work in English.[^antipassive]

[^antipassive]: In English we can however build something similar by using a passive construction: "Father returned and was seen by mother". Much as the passive can be used to promote an object to subject (and therefore pivot) status, in languages with syntactic ergativity there is typically an *antipassive* construction that promotes ergative arguments to absolutive ones [146--152][#dixon94].

While in Dyirbal ergativity is manifest both in morphology (albeit with a split on the first and second person pronouns) and syntax, this appears to be rather rare: most morphologically ergative languages seem to work in terms of an S/A pivot. Some languages even have a mixed pivot, e.g. in Yidiny coordination operates sometimes in terms of S/A and sometimes of S/P, while relative clauses are sensitive to S/P [175--177][#dixon94].

But alignment patterns can be found in all kinds of grammatical constructions. [26][#donohue08;] notes for example that English past participles show split intransitive characteristics:

<!--
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item[A] *the eaten glutton
\item[SA] *the sung choir
\item[SP] the fallen leaves
\item[P] the beaten protesters
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
-->

One can easily see that a noun may only be modified by a past participle if it acts as an SP or P argument to the corresponding verb.

More generally, [#bickel10;] argues for what he calls the "construction-specific nature of grammatical relations". In that view, grammatical relations (and subsequently alignment systems) cannot be established with respect to a clause, but only with respect to particular constructions. As an example, he cites Nepali, where verbal affixes and case marking show different alignment types:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{nepali} Nepali \citep[400]{bickel10}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll ma ga-ẽ
     1SG.NOM go-1SG.PST
\glt `I went.'
\glend
\item
\gll mai-le timro ghar dekh-ẽ
     1SG-ERG your house.NOM see-1SG.PST
\glt `I saw your house.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Verbal marking in (<!--\ref{nepali}-->) is accusative; both S and A are cross-referenced by a suffix. On the other hand, case marking is clearly ergative, since only A, and not S, is marked by the suffix *-le*.

The three most salient constructions in which alignment patterns can show up are head marking (or agreement), dependent marking (i.e. case) and word order; [26--28][#donohue08;] calls these the *primary morphosyntactic coding devices*. Dyirbal and Latin are examples where the ergative respectively accusative alignment is most prominent in case marking (although Latin also shows this with respect to verbal agreement), while word order is very free. In English however, since only pronouns are marked for case and only the third person singular triggers agreement on the verb, word order is much more salient and the primary way of distinguishing arguments; S and A generally precede the verb while P follows it in unmarked sentences, that is, word order is accusatively aligned.

While it is possible for every alignment type to be displayed in any of the three primary morphosyntactic coding devices, their distribution is not uniform. It would therefore be interesting to get a measure both of how frequent each alignment type is in general and how frequent it is with respect to a specific coding device. A rough estimate can be given by examining the distributions given in *The World Atlas of Language Structures* (WALS), which are split between pronominal, NP and verbal marking. Since many languages do not have one kind of marking or the other (e.g. many languages don't have any kind of (pro-)nominal case), the frequency of the "neutral" languages that show no alignment pattern at all is rather high for each construction. Table <!--\ref{wals-dist}--> gives the frequencies of the three alignment types for each construction in a different row; I have included in the last column all languages that have neutral or some kind of other marking for that particular construction. 

| **Construction**   | **Nominative-accusative** | **Ergative-absolutive** | **Split intransitive** | **Other/Unmarked** |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------       |
| *NP marking*       | 27% (52/190)              | 17% (32/190)            | 2% (4/190)             | 54% (102/190)      |
| *Pronoun marking*  | 37% (64/172)              | 12% (20/172)            | 2% (3/172)             | 49% (85/190)       |
| *Verbal marking*   | 56% (212/380)             | 5% (19/380)             | 7% (26/380)            | 32% (123/380)      |
[Distribution of alignment types according to WALS [#wals-comrie,wals-siewierska]][wals-dist]

Of course one has to be careful when comparing such frequencies; the underlying data is not the same for the three rows, so they cannot technically be compared to each other meaningfully; nevertheless, this can serve as a first approximation to the relative frequencies. Accusative languages are much more frequent than the other types, although the difference in frequency is smaller for case marking; split intransitive marking generally is the least common of those three alignment types, except when it comes to verbal marking, where it seems to be more or less as frequent as ergativity. In particular, it seems as if most split intransitive patterns are found in verbal marking which accounts for the fact that many languages exhibiting this pattern are head-marking in nature. 

Unfortunately, WALS does not include a similar distribution for word order, but [49--52][#dixon94;] notes that it rarely exhibits ergativity. He also mentions (p. 76--77) a few examples of languages with split intransitivity in word order, including the Arawak language Waurá. I will not discuss this language in the present thesis, but some of the languages examined here appear to be similar in that respect (see chapter <!--\ref{empirical}-->).

## A more empirical approach [rigour]
Typologists nowadays have become increasingly aware of the difficulty of finding a common ground (a *tertium comparationis*) for cross-linguistic comparison [see e.g. \]\[][#lazard02,cysouw07,bickel07,haspelmath07,haspelmath10a,itkonen10], although the notion that every language can only be described on its own terms had already been established by structuralism. Our definition of split intransitivity so far has been cast in the terms of the semantic primitives S, A and P, which are one such attempt at establishing a framework for language comparison. But these terms have not remained uncontroversial for a number of reasons. This section will attempt to provide a more solid theoretical foundation.

[#mithun99;] argue that S, A and P are inappropriate for the analysis of most languages. In their view the way in which participants are related to verbs can be significantly different across different languages, allowing for a wide range of conceptualisations. Accordingly, describing grammatical relations in these terms wouldn't do justice to the unique nature of individual languages. In particular, they claim that "split intransitive" languages encode semantic roles directly, not via the intermediate step of grammatical relations: agents are always marked as agents and patients as patients. A category like S with its two subtypes SA and SP would, so they argue, obscure the fundamental unity of SA and A or SP and P---for similar arguments see e.g. [89--93][#vanvalin;] who states that there is no reason to assume the existence of grammatical relations for every language or [23--38][#dixon94;] who distinguishes between 'syntactically' and 'semantically based' systems. As <!--\citeauthor{mithun99}--> observe,

> speakers of [split intransitive languages] could say with equal justification that English is a 'split patient' language, since English sometimes marks patients as subjects, sometimes as objects. [578][#mithun99].

One might question the assumption that some languages encode agent and patient directly; the previously mentioned idiosyncratic exceptions to split intransitive patterns in languages like Lakhota, where non-agentive arguments are sometimes marked as SA, seem to indicate that this relationship may not be as straightforward as claimed. Also, the alternatives <!--\citeauthor{mithun99}--> propose---in particular the notion of 'starting point'---don't seem all that compelling either, mainly due to a lack of precise definition. But that's not really at issue here, for these are hermeneutic considerations inquiring about the way individual languages can be understood to function. These are important in their own right, and maybe fields like psycholinguistics can offer more substantial input to them. If however typology is to be an empirical discipline---and I believe it is---in other words, if it aims to be the study of "what's where why" [to quote\]\[][#bickel07], we need to seek concepts amenable to cross-linguistic comparison in an as straightforward and unambiguous manner as possible, by operationalising the concepts we are interested in studying into variables that are directly observable. We may call these kinds of variables *comparative concepts* [#haspelmath10a]. It is important to note that they are entirely made up by linguists for the purpose of language comparison. There is no claim about some sort of psychological reality of such concepts here---in fact, I doubt that speakers of any language have concepts of S, A or P, or of many other typological variables, for that matter. I also subscribe to the view expressed in [#haspelmath07,haspelmath10a;] that comparative and language-particular categories cannot be equated.[^haspelmath-change] This goes back to the structuralist line of thought which maintained that the supposedly same category in two different languages can never really be the same, since they are taking part in different systems of oppositions to other categories. For that reason it is impossible to take that category as a basis for linguistic comparison; typological variables have to be defined independently from language-particular ones. In terms of this discussion, precisely because there are so many incommensurable ways in which languages may encode the relationship between referents and events, these cannot be used as a framework for typological research but must remain confined to language-specific descriptions---which themselves do not have to rely on S, A and P necessarily, as [#mithun99;] rightly claim. Instead of such language-specific categories, one has therefore to use a universally applicable set of comparative concepts in order to carry out cross-linguistic studies. Under this light, it doesn't matter whether S, A or P relate in any way to the internal workings of particular languages, as long as they are consistently defined. Whether they are good theoretical primitives can be determined *a posteriori*, considering whether their use has contributed significant insights.[^haspelmath-vs-mithun]

[^haspelmath-change]: [#haspelmath07;] assumes that only semantics (or phonetics) are a valid basis for cross-linguistic comparison. But while it is easier to find universally comparable concepts in the domain of semantics, I believe that any variable established in an unambiguous way and applied consistently across languages is a potential comparative concept---including structural properties that are meaningfully defined for every (spoken) language, such as linear ordering of elements. [#haspelmath10a;] seems to be less radical, as he allows for general comparative concepts established on the basis of any kind of universal notions (or combinations thereof).

[^haspelmath-vs-mithun]: For a similar argument that one should not dismiss S, A and P as comparative concepts see [552, note 16][#haspelmath10a;].

To be used as comparative concepts, S, A and P would have to be defined in a systematic and rigourous way. However, these primitives have been used in a number of very different and mutually incompatible ways by different scholars, as [#haspelmath11;] shows. In Dixon's line of thought in particular, their theoretical status is often unclear. For example, [8][#dixon94;] notes that languages are fairly consistent in deciding which argument is A and which one is P; but establishing primitives defined in terms of particular languages in order to describe those languages appears circular in logic. Similarly, he offers no clear way of distinguishing which argument is P in ditransitive constructions. This indicates that his semantic primitives are not really typological variables established a priori, in which case individual languages would have no say in their definition and in which case the definition would have to be unambiguous in all types of constructions. [542--545][#haspelmath11;] also remarks on his lack of concern over "non-typical" transitive clauses. In many languages there are clauses that behave like transitive clauses in some respects, but are not fully identical with them; or similarly, which have two arguments, but do not behave as one would expect from a transitive clause [see e.g.\]\[150--172][#lazard02]. An example would be the Lakhota "double patient" construction:[^infix]
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \citet[517]{mithun91}
\gll iyé<ni><ma>č\textsuperscript{h}eča
     <1SG.P><2SG.P>look.like
\glt `I look like you.'
\glend
\end{examples}
-->

[^infix]: Because of the lack of glossing, I analysed the person markers as infixes, but it is entirely possible that the verb could be further decomposed morphologically.

In this type of construction, both arguments are marked with patientive affixes. But how is it then possible to define which of the two is A and which one is P? Leaving these kinds of questions unanswered means that A and P are not defined unambiguously enough, i.e. they cannot be meaningfully used as comparative concepts in typology.

In order to avoid such problems and to establish the semantic primitives as true comparative concepts, I will for the present thesis define A and P in terms of a prototypical transitive construction. Following [#lazard02;],[^xyz] such a construction---which he calls the *Major Bi-Actant Construction*, or MBC---can be established on semantic grounds as the one used by a number of prototypical transitive verbs such as *hit*, *kill*, *break*. We can then identify the A role as the agent participant (the hitter, killer, etc.) and the P role as the patient (the affected entity, such as the one who is being hit, the killed, etc.). To say that a category such as S (which I will attempt to define shortly) "behaves" like A or P, is, therefore, equivalent to stating that it is encoded the same way as one of the participants of the MBC. Notice that since it was established that alignment is construction-specific, this means that S may behave like either A or P with respect to some constructions, but not with respect to others.

[^xyz]: Lazard uses X and Y, instead of A and P, but again, this is just a notational variant.

Under this definition, A and P, while initially identified via the semantics of prototypical transitive verbs, become then independent of the semantics of particular verbs. In other words, it doesn't matter how agentive or patientive an argument to a particular (non-prototypical) verb is---all that counts is the similarity of encoding to the agent or patient of the MBC. This definition contrasts with the one used e.g. by [#bickel10;]. In that kind of definition, A and P are newly established for each particular verb depending on the relative agentivity of the arguments, the more agent-like being A, the more patient-like being P. For example, as argued by [#haspelmath11;], the approach used by Bickel would have to identify an A and a P argument in the German sentence in (<!--\ref{german-obl}-->), even though both arguments are marked obliquely and not at all in the same way that A and P are marked in the MBC (<!--\ref{german-mbc}-->). Lazard's approach used here, on the other hand, would not define A and P with respect to a sentence such as (<!--\ref{german-obl}-->), where no argument is marked the same as either A or P in (<!--\ref{german-mbc}-->). 
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{german-obl} \citet[553]{haspelmath11}
\glll Mir graut vor dem Examen.
      1SG.DAT dread of the.DAT exam.DAT
      A {} P
\glt `I am dreading the exam.'

\item\label{german-mbc}

      A {} {} P

\end{examples}

One could argue over the respective merits and drawbacks of each approach. It may be true, as [#haspelmath11;] claims, that it is much more difficult to define "agentivity" for non-prototypical verbs (such as stimulus-experiencer verbs), and for that reason some linguists [e.g.\]\[][#vanvalin] have introduced the concept of 'macro-roles' such as actor and undergoer; but, unlike Haspelmath, I don't want to argue a priori against the usage of Bickel's concepts. In a domain such as lexical typology, which is concerned with the way specific lexical items behave across languages, this is probably a useful approach [for an example of a study based on those concepts see\]\[][#nichols08]. As long as it is rigourously defined and consistently applied, each approach will be as good as the results and insights it produces and both may very well be valid---for that reason it would be best if those very different concepts were expressed by different terminology. This unfortunately isn't the case, which adds a lot of confusion to any argument involving the primitives S, A and P, with many typologists not actually stopping to explain the theoretical status of the concepts they use in greater detail. 

Nevertheless, the approach based on Lazard and the MBC has a few benefits. For example, it effortlessly accommodates the fact that transitivity may not be a binary category but rather a continuum on which many different types of constructions can exist. Examples like the double patient construction in Lakhota or stimulus-experiencers verb would pose no problem for this definition, since A and P are not defined in terms of them, and the same is true for ditransitive verbs or verbs with oblique objects. It can be argued [see e.g.\]\[438][#haspelmath11] that while prototypical constructions are similar across languages, non-prototypical constructions can vary almost infinitely; in other words, this approach tries to separate what stays the same from what's changing,[^prog-wis] the universal (it is hoped) communicative patterns (here, the MBC) from the language-specific constructions (all kinds of constructions in any way related to or opposed to the MBC). 

[^prog-wis]: To quote a piece of wisdom from the otherwise unrelated discipline of software engineering.

Unlike A and P, S proves a little more difficult to define with the same amount of rigour. The issue here is that we cannot really employ a semantic approach, given that a notion of "prototypical intransitivity" makes little sense when what we really want to establish is a split across different types of intransitive verbs. We are therefore limited to structural properties, and since we know that the structures of individual languages vary to an almost unpredictable extent, this poses a problem. I am nevertheless going to assume that we can identify in each language verbs that are structurally fully intransitive, i.e. take only a single argument.[^ambitransitives] This definition relies on the assumptions that first, it is possible for each language to define what a "verb" is (as opposed to other word classes, such as adjectives), and second, that it is always unproblematic to tell arguments from e.g. adjuncts. Both of these assumptions are problematic. While the argument-adjunct opposition did not pose complications for my analyses in the present thesis, the question of what constitutes a verb certainly was relevant, as Arawak SP verbs are generally translated by adjectives. I will not try to resolve this (important and non-trivial) issue here, but simply state that I considered a word class to be (sufficiently) "verbal" if it could be marked with the same set of affixes as transitive verbs could, in particular person markers (a heuristic that works quite well with head-marking languages). Nevertheless, this issue remains a gap in the theory of split intransitivity so far, and it is to be hoped that it will be resolved elsewhere.

[^ambitransitives]: There are of course certain verbs that may take one or two arguments, depending on the meaning, such as English 'break' (*The vase broke* vs. *I broke the vase*). These are sometimes called *ambitransitives* [e.g.\]\[54][#dixon94]. It would be therefore more precise to identify intransitive verb *constructions*.

A further theoretical problem concerns the question of how encompassing a definition of split intransitivity ought to be. Donohue argues that Icelandic shows a split in its encoding of S, as in the following examples:

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{icelandic}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll Skipið sökk
     ship.NOM sank
\glt `The ship sank.'
\glend
\item
\gll Mér er kalt
     1SG.DAT is cold
\glt `I am cold.'
\glend
\item 
\gll  Drengina rak á land
      boys.ACC drifted to land
\glt `The boys drifted to land.'
\glend
\item 
\gll Vindsins gœtir ekki
     wind.GEN matter not
\glt `The wind does not matter.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

The S arguments in (<!--\ref{icelandic}-->) all are marked with different cases, but unlike Donohue, I don't think it is useful to include them as an example of split intransitivity. As [#haig10;] notes, verbs with oblique S arguments exist in a lot of languages and have so far been studied under terms such as quirky cases or differential subject/object marking. In German, for example, basically the same construction as in (<!--\ref{icelandic}-->b) is possible (recall also example (<!--\ref{german-obl}-->), with its oblique experiencer argument); but this is a minor pattern, not the prototypical case, and I suspect the situation is similar in Icelandic. I believe that it would obscure the theoretical discussion to study such constructions within the topic of split intransitivity. For this reason, I only consider a pattern to be split intransitive if the classification is systematic and not restricted to a few idiosyncratic cases (similar to how a few irregular verbs do not affect the semantic basis for classification, as discussed before). I will also, although this might be debatable, limit the definition to situations where S is marked either like A or like P and not in any different way; arguably, encoding S as an oblique argument is a much more marked pattern than encoding it as a core argument. I therefore assume that the mechanisms at work are others in such a situation.[^oblique-bickel]

[^oblique-bickel]: However, in an approach such as the one used by Bickel, where the semantic primitives are defined for all verbs according to their agency, it would be interesting to include exactly those cases, as they could lead to a study of which kinds of verbs tend to obliquely mark their arguments cross-linguistically.

With all the theoretical foundations in place, I can now proceed to a definition of split intransitivity which, I hope, is more useful for empirical research than previous ones:

<!--
\begin{description}
\item[1] A construction can be said to display split intransitive alignment if:
\begin{description}
\item[1.1] S arguments are treated sometimes like A and sometimes like P by this construction, where:
\begin{description}
\item[1.1.1] S is the single argument of an intransitive (monovalent) verb.
\item[1.1.2] A and P are defined as the agent and patient of the MBC.
\end{description}
\item[1.2] The assignment of an S argument to the A-like or the P-like class depends on the lexical semantics of the verb.
\item[1.3] The classification is systematic and not confined to a few exceptional cases.
\end{description}
\item[2] Different constructions in the same language may differ in whether they display split intransitivity or not.
\item[3] The semantic basis according to which verbs are classified may be different across languages.
\end{description}
-->

## A note on terminology [terminology]
A number of alternative labels have been used for split intransitivity. Widely used are terms such as *active-stative* or *agent-patient* (or similar); these terms only refer to subclasses of split intransitive alignment, since the semantic bases are different across languages.[^terminology-aspect] Even then, it would be more precise to specify the semantic basis of a language more exactly, since e.g. languages focusing on agentivity do not have to be identical in terms of classification (such as Lakhota and Central Pomo). [#wichmann;] and [#donohue08;] propose the term *semantic alignment*. I reject that term out of two reasons: First, it has not gained any widespread acceptance, and even in the same volume, most authors use different terminology.[^xkcd] Second, especially in Donohue's account semantic alignment seems to generally encompass all types of constructions in which argument encoding may be explained (partially, or primarily) with respect to the arguments' semantic roles. Again, I think that defining split intransitivity in such a way confuses the language-specific descriptive-hermeneutic categories with cross-linguistic comparative concepts. I do not even consider labels such as *unaccusative* or *unergative*, as they assume underlying notions like deep and surface structure, which I reject [see\]\[5][#wichmann]. The term *split intransitive* seems to be best suited as a label for a true comparative concept as its name refers directly to its definition: a split in the marking of intransitive sentences. A very similar term is *split-S* [used e.g. by\]\[][#dixon94]. It is arguably even more precise, but I think that "split intransitivity" is more telling in general, since not every linguist may be familiar with the concept of the three semantic primitives, whereas intransitivity is a better-known term.[^pronounceable]

[^pronounceable]: It also happens to be more pronounceable, or at least easier to parse in a spoken context.

Of course, eventually the term employed for the phenomenon investigated here is not really important; what is crucial is to have a clear and unambiguous definition for the pattern at hand, something which I have attempted to do in this chapter.

[^xkcd]: In general, when so many different terms are already being used for one single phenomenon, it seems like a bad idea to throw a new one into the mix.

[^terminology-aspect]: Although, as argued, it is questionable whether lexical aspect is the semantic basis in all the languages where this has been claimed.
