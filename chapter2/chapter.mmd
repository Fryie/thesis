# Towards a theory of split intransitivity
Blahblah

## A preliminary definition
Owing to ancient Greek and Latin tradition, work on grammatical relations (that is, on the way verbal arguments are encoded) used to be based on the terms "subject" and "object". It became however clear, when studying languages that did things differently than most European languages, that those notions were not truly amenable to cross-linguistic comparisons, since they denote bundles of properties that do not need to coincide in many languages, instead of true syntactic primitives. Starting with the work on *ergativity*, such as [#comrie78;] or [#dixon94;], the terms S, A and P as more general alternative have become increasingly established[for a history of the terms see\]\[??--?][#haspelmath11]

### S, A and P
As used by [6--8][#dixon94;] the terms S, A and P[^o-vs-p] are based on the observation that every language makes a basic distinction between *intransitive* verbs (having one argument) and *transitive* verbs (having two or more arguments). S is simply defined to be the single argument of the intransitive verb, while A and P map onto the transitive arguments---in the case of verbs with more than two arguments, only two of them will be identified as A and P.[^other-roles] The distinction between A and P is semantically based (unlike S, which is defined purely in syntactical terms) and Dixon notes how consistent different languages seem to be with respect to it; for 'hit' it is the hitter, for 'give' the giver, for 'speak' the speaker, etc., that will be assigned to A. Generally, "that role which is most likely to be relevant to the success of the activity will be identified as A" [8][#dixon94]. In two-argument constructions, the other argument will be O; but in constructions with more arguments, there seems to be no fixed rule as to which of the non-A arguments should be the O argument. A more accessible (if not particularly robust) definition would be:

> **A** refers to that argument of a transitive verb which would be its subject in a non-ergative language like English [<!--\ldots-->] and P refers to the argument that would be the direct object. [??][#comrie78]

In the intransitive sentence "I sleep", *I* would be the S argument, while in the transitive sentence "I hit the slave", *I* would be identified as A and *the slave* as P. Note that this is not a fact about English, but holds true for any language, regardless of the way arguments are actually encoded.

[^o-vs-p]: Dixon (as well as many others) actually uses O instead of P, but this is a mere notational variant. I prefer to use P, because it reminiscent of the semantic notion of *patient*, instead of the cross-linguistically less applicable term *object*.

[^other-roles]: Subsequently, linguists have adopted terms to specify those additional arguments as well, such as G for the goal argument (citations?).

### Nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems
The definition of arguments in terms of S, A and P serves as a theoretical framework in order to describe the way grammatical relations are expressed in particular languages. While it is conceivable that languages use specific devices (e.g. case) to distinguish S, A and P all from one another, one finds that this *tripartite* system is rarely used [40][#dixon94;]. The reason for this is that, while it is necessary to distinguish the arguments of a transitive sentence, S does not need to be distinguished from anything, since it occurs by itself. Most languages, therefore, treat the S argument formally either like the A argument or like the P argument (this is also called *(morphosyntactic) alignment*, since the grammatical primitives are effectively aligned, i.e. formally equated, in one way or another). Languages that encode S like A are said to belong to the *nominative-accusative* type; the ones that encode S like P belong to the *ergative-absolutive* type.[^abbrev] In case-marking languages often the following traditional names are used:

|     |*Nominative-accusative*|*Ergative-absolutive* |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------------|
|**A**| nominative            |ergative              |
|**S**| nominative            |absolutive            |
|**P**| accusative            |absolutive            |
[Traditional names for grammatical cases]

For accusative languages, there is often a terminological distinction between "nominative" and "accusative", which are reserved for nominal case, and the terms "subject" and "object" for the corresponding grammatical relations, irrespective of marking---although some linguists, like [??][#dixon94;], use the term "subject" more generally for any kind of ?? that aligns S with A, even in ergative languages. A similar distinction does not seem to exist for ergative languages. [Is this stuff true?]

The distinction between those two types of languages can be illustrated by comparing Latin (of the accusative type) with Dyirbal (of the absolutive type; both are case-marking languages):[^latin-dyirbal-exs]

As we see, Latin uses the same nominative ending *-us* for the S relation and the A relation, but a different ending, the accusative *-um*, for the P relation. By contrast, in Dyirbal S and P are both in the unmarked absolutive case, whereas the A argument appears with the ergative ending *-ŋu*.

[^latin-dyirbal-exs]: Examples are adapted from [9--10][#dixon94;].

[^abbrev]: The alignment types are often (and henceforth also in this thesis) abbreviated to just *accusative* and *ergative*.

### Split intransitivity
While accusative and ergative systems encode S uniformly the same way as either A or P, in a number of languages this is not the case. Instead S is sometimes marked as A and sometimes as P, depending on the semantics of the verb, and whether the intransitive argument is perceived to be agent-like or not. Since the class of intransitive verbs is thus split, this system is called *split intransitivity* or *split-S* (see below for a discussion of terminology). A well-known example is Lakhota:

LAKHOTA EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION (introduce terms Sa, So)

Split intransitive languages can behave very differently. On the one hand, [70--83][#dixon94;] distinguishes between *split-S* and *fluid-S* languages: While in the former type the choice of marking is fixed for each verb, according to the *prototypical* semantics, the latter allows Sa and So marking for the same verb, depending on the *situational* semantics or pragmatics; in such a language it may be possible, for example, to indicate the volitionality or degree of control that a participant possessed with respect to a particular event.

BANIWA DO IÇANA (or just refer to it? - later chapter?)

Languages also differ in the exact semantic basis for the split. [#mithun91;] notes that in semantically aligned languages, classification of verbs is usually based on a shared set of semantic characteristics, but that both cross-linguistically and language-internally the distributions are not fully predictable. The basis for assignment is lexical aspect in some languages and agentiveness in others; also, languages may vary with respect to the precise agentive or aspectual property that governs the split. For this reason, translational equivalents are not uniformly marked across languages, even though the individual systems are coherent in themselves.

To understand those systems fully, it is necessary to consider the dynamic processes that shaped them. In Guaraní, intransitive verbs may be of one of two classes. The first class takes the A-set of pronominal prefixes and is used for events, while the second class with the P-prefixes usually denotes states. The split is therefore based on dynamicity. There are, however, some exceptions. In cases of lexicalisation, where the meaning of a verb expands or shifts, the original set of prefixes is retained. Another factor obscuring the picture is language contact. When words were borrowed from Spanish, what was a verb in Spanish generally was categorized as event (and thus received
A-prefixes), while what was an adjective was categorized as state (receiving P-prefixes). EXAMPLES

In Lakhota, on the other hand, agency is the key factor in determining alignment. Agentive intransitive subjects are marked as Sa and patientive ones as Sp. However, the concept of 'agentivity' is in itself vague and encompasses several basic features that usually, but not always coincide. These are performance/effect/instigation and control. When there are conflicting features, it is performance/effect/instigation that takes precedence. Thus, 'to sneeze' is expressed with Sa marking even though the argument typically lacks control. Mithun also notes that not only with intransitive but also with some transitive verbs, agency is important for case marking. If neither argument can be classified as Agent, both are marked as P. Sa/A marking is more marked and only highly agentive arguments are marked this way. As with
Guaraní, there are some verbs where this distinction has become blurred due to lexicalisation.

In Central Pomo, the picture is more complex. The system is based on agency, and it seems that the distinction is based on control. Thus, unlike in Lakhota, sneezers are marked as patients. It even appears as though control is more important than volition, since 'to win in gambling' is expressed with a patientive argument. However, not all arguments that are not in control, are marked as patients --- they must be significantly affected, too, to get this marking. Interestingly, inherent state predicates appear with A arguments, but their inchoative equivalents with P arguments. That is, in the latter case the argument is viewed as being more significantly affected. The patient case is even more marked, seeing as it is usually only applied to human beings, and even then only when the speaker wished to portray the affectedness. The system in Central Pomo is thus based on the interaction of two factors, control and affectedness.

In all those languages, most verbs are classified uniformly, since the relevant features tend to coincide. It is only where they don't that there are differences across the languages.

ARKADIEV

A number of other languages show a different kind of split: in Dyirbal, first and second person pronouns are accusatively marked, as opposed to third person pronouns and full NPs. In Georgian, perfective clauses display ergative alignment, but imperfective ones are accusatively marked (?). These splits that are conditioned by properties of the clause or of the arguments, instead of verbal semantics (or pragmatics) are generally not considered to be instances of split intransitivity; they are commonly referred to as *split ergativity*[see e.g. \]\[83--104][#dixon94].

### Construction-specificity of grammatical relations
Not all constructions have to align S, A and P in the same way. This is most radically formulated by [??][#bickel10;]: "??", but has been recognized before. Blahblah syntactic vs. morphological---pivots---examples 

While Dyirbal and Latin both use case marking for the marking of arguments (and both have very flexible word order), ergativity or accusativity can show up in other kinds of marking as well; for example English has little morphology, but its accusative alignment can be seen (apart from the third person verbal agreement and pronominal case) by the fact that S and A generally come before the verb while P comes after in typical sentences. Conversely, as it has been claimed (citations?) that there exist no verb-medial ergative languages (or at least that they are very rare), and therefore that in ergative languages S, A and P will (almost) always appear on the same side of the verb, it will by consequence be uncommon for ergativity to be displayed by word-order [see also\]\[49--52][#dixon94]. Tolai and split intransitivity by word order (Dixon 76)?

It is not so easy to assess how frequent the different types are, especially as alignment can be dependant on the specific construction (see below). A rough estimate can be given by examining the distributions given in the *World Atlas of Linguistic Structure*, which, unfortunately, are split between pronominal, NP and verbal marking. Since many languages do not have one kind of marking or the other (e.g. many languages don't have any kind of (pro-)nominal case), it makes sense to calculate the ratio not only of an alignment type with respect to the whole sample, but also specifically with respect to the subsample that has any kind of such marking. [#wals-comrie,wals-siewierska]

|**Construction**  |**Nominative-accusative**|**Ergative-absolutive**|**Split intransitive**|
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
|*NP marking*      | 27% (52/190)            | 17% (32/190)          | 2% (4/190)           |
| -- of all marked | 57% (52/92)             | 35% (32/92)           | 4% (4/92)            |

|*Pronoun marking* | 37% (64/172)            | 12% (20/172)          | 2% (3/172)           |
| -- of all marked | 69% (64/93)             | 22% (20/93)           | 3% (3/93)            |

|*Verbal marking*  | 56% (212/380)           | 5% (19/380)           | 7% (26/380)          |
| -- of all marked | 72% (212/296)           | 6% (19/296)           | 9% (26/380)          |
[Distribution of alignment types acording to WALS]

Of course, such a distributional analysis is flawed, primarily because the data samples (even if they are chosen to be well-balanced by themselves, something that is notoriously difficult in typology, given the sparsity of data [see\]\[??][#bickel10]) are not the same for the three construction types. Nonetheless we may tentatively conclude that ...

## Issues??
Talk about tertium comparationis [see for example\]\[][#cysouw07,haspelmath07,haspelmath10a,lazard02].

There are a couple of issues and problems with our definition of split intransitivity thus far. They include:

1. Grammatical relations are specific to constructions, not clauses [#bickel10]. THIS SHOULD BE IN THE PRECEDING SECTION W. EX.
2. Transitivity is not a binary category [others??\]\[][#lazard02].
3. Are S, A and P really comparative concepts? [#mithun99].
4. Different definitions of S, A and P [#haspelmath11].
5. comparative concept or descriptive category?

Let's discuss those in turn.

Dixon's definition is problematic because: it assumes a) that transitive-intransitive is a binary distinction, b) that there is one type of transitive clause with uniform assignment to A and P---but both are not true. We should therefore separate what stays the same (prototypical transitive, intransitive) from what changes (all possible shades of variations of non-canonical constructions that can vary almost infinitely from language to language).

Basically, I want to use Lazard's definition of transitivity (see also Comrie, and the discussion of different notions in [#haspelmath11;]), major biactant construction, to define A and P, and find a comparable definition for prototypical intransitive clause (maybe just: construction with a sole argument) -> S. Then find languages where S is not uniformly encoded, in particular, where it is sometimes encoded as A and sometimes as P. (What happens in Arawak?) I also propose: *systematic* variance (in order to exclude occasional quirky cases as in "Mich friert").

Highlight also the arbitrariness of comparative concepts: are they useful or not? While Dixon's S, A and O lack clear theoretical status e.g. w.r.t. non-canonical sentences, Bickel's concepts are well-defined --- but are they useful? This is an *a posteriori* question, in this thesis I am going to employ the Lazard definition. However, Bickel's observation that alignment cannot be defined on per-clause-basis but on per-construction-basis, is important (and does this apply to e.g. English past participles?).

blah[^note]

[^note]: In practice, however, it can be hard (or even impossible) to exactly tell when two constructions are the same, and when they are different. [where?][#croft01;] notes this when he says that "there's no end to splitting" (exact quote?).
