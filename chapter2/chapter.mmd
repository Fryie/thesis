# Towards a theory of split intransitivity [theory]
Although split intransitivity has been studied for some time (see <!--\citealt{wichmann}--> for a history), I feel that to this date there is no adequate theoretical foundation for the pattern---[#donohue08;] notwithstanding. I will first introduce split intransitivity in section <!--\ref{preliminary}--> as it is most commonly understood by linguists today, using the three semantic primitives *S*, *A* and *P*. Unfortunately these are not unproblematic and often not rigourously defined by many scholars working on split intransitivity, which may lead to a number of subtle (but important) problems. Building upon work of [#haspelmath11;] and [#lazard02;], I will then in section <!--\ref{rigour}--> attempt to develop a solid more empirically grounded approach to S, A and P, and subsequently to split intransitivity.

## A preliminary definition [preliminary]
*Grammatical relations* is the term generally used to refer to morphosyntactic properties of verbal arguments to specific constructions (see e.g. <!--\citealt{bickel10}--> for a general introduction to the subject---although my approach to grammatical relations will be somewhat different, as discussed in section <!--\ref{rigour}-->). Traditionally, grammatical relations have been described in terms of the notions of "subject" and "object". For the description of most (Indo-)European languages this has turned out to be unproblematic, which doubtless led to the assumption that those concepts would be applicable to more exotic languages as well. Languages such as Basque (spoken in Europe, but not Indo-European) or Dyirbal (an Australian aboriginal language of the Pama-Nyungan family) however challenge those terms as they deny the unity of the transitive and the intransitive subject; for that reason the terms are not truly amenable to cross-linguistic comparisons (or at least not unless defined more precisely). Linguists working on *ergativity*, such as [#comrie78;] or [#dixon94;], have introduced the terms S, A and P as a more general alternative and  they have subsequently become increasingly established[for a history of the terms see\]\[??--?][#haspelmath11]. I will introduce these terms now, as they will serve as the background for the study of split intransitivity as carried out here. As mentioned before, I will revisit S, A and P more critically in section <!--\ref{rigour}-->.

### S, A and P
The terms S, A and P (or equivalent ones) have been used by a variety of authors, often with (sometimes subtle) differences in definitions. They are intended as *semantic primitives*, basic building blocks specifically designed for cross-linguistic comparison, with the goal of being more generally applicable than "subject" or "object". The introduction in this section is largely based on [6--8][#dixon94;],[^o-vs-p] which is more or less compatible to the way it is generally used by other linguists as well. The basic observation is that every language makes a fundamental distinction between *intransitive* verbs with only one argument (such as *go*, *sleep*, *die* or *sneeze*) and *transitive* verbs with two arguments (such as *kill*, *cut*, *open* or *draw*). The single argument of the intransitive clause is referred to by the label S, a definition that is purely syntactical. By contrast, the two arguments of the transitive clause, A and P, are distinguished on semantic grounds. According to [8][#dixon94;], "that role which is most likely to be relevant to the success of the activity will be identified as A". Dixon notes how consistent different languages seem to be with respect to this assignment; for 'hit' it is the hitter, for 'kill' the killer, for 'speak' the speaker, etc., that will be identified as A. This is even true for constructions with more than two arguments (*ditransitive* verbs, accordingly a subclass of transitive verbs), with the giver of 'give' generally being A as well. In two-argument constructions, the P role defaults to the only other argument; but in constructions with more arguments, there seems to be no fixed rule as to which of the non-A arguments should be the P argument.[^other-roles] Notice again the complex nature of the definition: S is syntactically determined, while A and P are identified partly on syntactic grounds (by virtue of being the two, or two out of several, arguments of a transitive verb) and partly on semantic grounds (with the semantic relationship of the arguments to the verb serving as the means to distinguish A from P).

Another way of defining A and P---not particulary robust and formal, but more intuitive and more or less equivalent---is the following one:

> **A** refers to that argument of a transitive verb which would be its subject in a non-ergative language like English [<!--\ldots-->] and P refers to the argument that would be the direct object. [??][#comrie78]

The following English sentences serve to illustrate the three semantic primitives:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll I sleep.
     S
\glt
\glend
\item
\gll I hit the slave.
     A {} {} P
\glt
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Notice that this is not a fact about English; in other languages, arguments would be assigned to the primitives in the same way, even though the actual way arguments are encoded may be very different to English.

[^o-vs-p]: Dixon (as well as many others) actually uses O instead of P, but this is a mere notational variant. I prefer to use P, because it reminiscent of the semantic notion of *patient*, instead of the cross-linguistically less applicable term *object*.

[^other-roles]: Subsequently, linguists have adopted terms to specify those additional arguments as well, such as G for the goal argument (citations?).

With S, A and P established as descriptive labels for cross-linguistic comparison we may now turn to the question how different languages behave in terms of them; as it turns out, there are some very important differences.

### Nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems
The definition of arguments in terms of S, A and P serves as a theoretical framework in order to describe the way grammatical relations are expressed in particular languages. While it is conceivable that languages use specific devices (e.g. case) to distinguish S, A and P all from one another, one finds that this *tripartite* system is rarely used [40][#dixon94]. The reason for this is that, while it is necessary to distinguish the arguments of a transitive sentence, S does not need to be distinguished from anything, since it occurs by itself. Most languages, therefore, treat the S argument formally either like the A argument or like the P argument. The way different semantic primitives are encoded similarly or differently from each other is called *(morphosyntactic) alignment*, since some of them are effectively being "aligned," i.e. formally equated, in one way or another. Languages that encode S like A are said to belong to the *nominative-accusative* type---English is one such language; the ones that encode S like P belong to the *ergative-absolutive* type.[^abbrev] In case-marking languages often the following traditional names are used for the marking categories:

|     |*Nominative-accusative*|*Ergative-absolutive* |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------------|
|**A**| nominative            |ergative              |
|**S**| nominative            |absolutive            |
|**P**| accusative            |absolutive            |
[Traditional names for grammatical cases]

For accusative languages, there is often a terminological distinction between "nominative" and "accusative," which are used for nominal case, and the terms "subject" and "object" for the corresponding grammatical relations, irrespective of marking---although some linguists, like [??][#dixon94;] [see also\]\[??][#bickel10], use labels like "subject" whenever there is some kind of common behaviour to S and A constituents even in non-accusative languages (Dixon mentions imperativ constructions as an example). A similar distinction does not seem to exist for ergative languages.

The distinction between those two types of languages can be illustrated by comparing Latin (of the accusative type) with Dyirbal (of the absolutive type; both are case-marking languages):[^latin-dyirbal-exs]

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item \emph{Latin}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\glll domin-us veni-t
      master-NOM come-3SG
      S
\glt `The master comes.'
\glend
\item
\glll domin-us serv-um audi-t
      master-NOM slave-ACC hear-3SG
      A P
\glt `The master hears the slave.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Dyirbal}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\glll ŋuma banaga-n\textsuperscript{y}u
      father.ABS return-NONFUT
      S
\glt `Father returned.'
\glend
\item
\glll yabu ŋuma-ŋu bura-n
      mother.ABS father-ERG see-NONFUT
      P A
\glt `Father saw mother.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

As we see, Latin uses the same nominative ending *-us* for the S relation and the A relation, but a different ending, the accusative *-um*, for the P relation. By contrast, in Dyirbal S and P are both in the unmarked absolutive case, whereas the A argument appears with the ergative ending *-ŋu*.

[^latin-dyirbal-exs]: Examples are adapted from [9--10][#dixon94;].

[^abbrev]: The alignment types are often (and henceforth also in this thesis) abbreviated to just *accusative* and *ergative*.

### Split intransitivity
While accusative and ergative systems encode S uniformly the same way as either A or P, in a number of languages this is not the case. Instead S is sometimes marked as A and sometimes as P, depending on the semantics of the verb, and whether the intransitive argument is perceived to be agent-like or not. Since the class of intransitive verbs is thus split, this system is called *split intransitivity* or *split-S* (see below for a discussion of terminology). A well-known example is Lakhota (see also the examples in section 1):[^lakhota2]

<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{lakhota-trans} transitive verbs \citep[514]{mithun91}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\gll Ø-wa-ktékte
     3P-1A-kill
\glt `I'll kill him.'
\glend
\item
\gll ma-Ø-ktékte
     1P-3A-kill
\glt `He'll kill me.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{lakhota-itr} intransitive verbs \citep[515]{mithun91}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll wa-núwe
     1A-swim
\glt `I swam.'
\glend
\item
\gll ma-t'é
     1P-die
\glt `I died.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Lakhota uses different prefixes for A and P arguments, as seen by the use of the first person markers *wa-* for A (<!--\ref{lakhota-trans}-->a) and *ma-* for P (<!--\ref{lakhota-trans}-->b). Intransitive verbs may however take either set of prefix, A (<!--\ref{lakhota-itr}-->a) or P (<!--\ref{lakhota-itr}-->b). The crucial difference between the two intransitive verbs is that 'swim' is a volitional and controlled activity, while 'die' refers to something that happens to a person (generally) without their involvement. In Lakhota, verbs that are similar to 'swim' take on A prefixes and verbs similar to 'die' P prefixes. Languages where S arguments may be marked either as A or as P and where this decision is based on the lexical semantics of the verb (or pragmatics of the utterance, see below), are called *split intransitive*, since the class of intransitive verbs is split into two subclasses with different alignment. Similar to [#dixon94;], I will use the terms SA verbs and SP verbs for the classes of verbs in split intransitive languages whose arguments are marked like A and P respectively.

[^lakhota2]: Again, the examples were not glossed in the original source. I included an overt representation for the unmarked third person argument to make the examples clearer.

Not all split intransitive languages are like Lakhota. On the one hand, [70--83][#dixon94;] distinguishes between *split-S* and *fluid-S* languages: While in the former type the choice of marking is fixed for each verb, according to the *prototypical* semantics, the latter allows SA and SO marking for the same verb, depending on the *situational* semantics or pragmatics; in such a language it may be possible, for example, to indicate the volitionality or degree of control that a participant possessed with respect to a particular event. Unfortunately, Dixon includes no clear examples of such languages. He mentions an Arawak language, Baniwa do Içana, that apparently exhibits this pattern; Baniwa do Içana is, according to Aikhenvald (??), the same language as Kurripako, which I discuss in section <!--\ref{kurripako}-->, but I found no clear indications of a fluid nature of the split in my source [#baure-kurri]. More convincing examples appear in [#mithun91;] (even though she does not use the term fluid-S). In Guaraní, some verbs may appear with either A or P marking; however this seems to indicate a shift in semantics rather than pragmatics (e.g. *mimí* translates to 'shine' when marked with A, but to 'be brilliant' when marked with P). More to the point might be Central Pomo; SP marking is apparently optional and only chosen if the speaker wants to highlight the affectedness of the participant.

Languages may also differ in the exact semantic criteria that decide whether a verb is going to be treated as an SA or an SP verb, as [#mithun91;] shows. In Lakhota this classification is sensitive to agentivity. Active participants are marked with A prefixes and patientive ones with P:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{lakhota3a} SA verbs \citep[515]{mithun91}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll wa-škáte
     1SG.A-play
\glt `I'm playing.'
\glend
\item
\gll wa-pšá
     1SG.A-sneeze
\glt `I sneezed.'
\glend
\item
\gll wa-xpaye
     1SG.A-lie
\glt `I'm lying.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{lakhota3b} SP verbs \citep[515-516]{mithun91}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll ma-t'é
     1SG.P-die
\glt `I fainted, died.'
\glend
\item
\gll ma-sláte
     1SG.P-slow
\glt `I'm slow.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Agentivity is not an atomic concept; when characteristics of agency contradict, it appears that Lakhota treats performers or instigators of an action like agents, even when they possess no control over the action itself, as in (<!--\ref{lakhota3a}-->b). 

In Guaraní, the semantic basis for split intransitivity is different. Many verbs whose arguments have neither control over the action nor are actually performing it, are SA verbs, such as *manó*, 'die' or *kašá*, 'stagger'. Mithun claims that split intransivity in Guaraní is sensitive to lexical aspect and that it is state verbs that are treated as SP verbs. However, I'm not convinced of this analysis. Almost all of the examples of SP verbs she cites (e.g. *aimé*, 'be sharp', *aranú*, 'be wise', *karapé*, 'be short') are translated into English with the use of adjectives (and Mithun even states that adjectives borrowed from Spanish are generally treated as SP verbs in Guaraní). This indicates that they refer to (temporary or permanent) physical, emotional or mental properties of the participant. By contrast, a stative verb like *ké*, 'sleep', is listed as an SA verb. While the distinction between properties and states may not in all cases be clear (and while a more rigorous study of lexical aspect and other semantic properties of verbs is outside the scope of the present thesis), I maintain that this is an important distinction. With the limited data presented here, it is not possible to provide a more precise analysis of whether SP verbs in Guaraní are really state verbs or rather property-denoting verbs, but as will be shown in chapter <!--\ref{empirical}-->, Arawak languages it is generally the latter aspect that is relevant for the categorisation of intransitive verbs. In what follows, I will use the term *descriptive verb* to refer to that kind of verbs which usually translates to adjectives in English.[^descriptive-where]

[^descriptive-where]: I don't know where the term originated, but it is used e.g. by [#facundes00;] in his grammar of Apurinã.

A more complex system is found in Central Pomo; I already mentioned that SP marking is optional. Additionally, it can only be applied to participants who are both out of control (sneezers are SP arguments in Central Pomo, unlike in Lakhota) and significantly affected; split intransitivity is therefore sensitive to the interplay between two different semantic properties of verbs.

Mithun also notes that there are often some irregular and non-predictable patterns in split intransitive languages, due to factors such as grammaticalisation, lexicalisation or analogy. For example, the Guaraní verb *esaví*, 'wink', is an SP verb, since it literally means 'to have defective eyes'. This highlights the fact that, as all patterns in language, alignment systems must also be partially understood in terms of their historic development.

Notice that there is a set of verbs which are expected to be treated the same in all languages with split intransitivity. Events whose argument is in control of and performing the action are SA verbs uniformly across languages; similarly if a language has descriptive verbs (as opposed to using non-verbal constructions such as adjectives for properties of participants), it is likely that these will be SP verbs. These sets of verbs where agentivity, lexical aspect and being a property coincide connect all those different semantic bases and it is quite likely that it is from these verbs that the more refined and complex marking systems in individual languages arose, by focusing on either one or the other aspect of the verbal semantics.

ARKADIEV

A number of other languages show a different kind of split: in Dyirbal, first and second person pronouns are accusatively marked, as opposed to third person pronouns and full NPs. In Georgian, perfective clauses display ergative alignment, but imperfective ones are accusatively marked (?). These splits that are conditioned by properties of the clause or of the arguments, instead of verbal semantics (or pragmatics) are generally not considered to be instances of split intransitivity; they are commonly referred to as *split ergativity*[see e.g. \]\[83--104][#dixon94].

### Construction-specificity of grammatical relations
[??][#comrie78;] and [11--18,143--181][#dixon94;] already noted that it is necessary to distinguish between *morphological* and *syntactic* ergativity. While the former term refers to the actual encoding of argument, the latter is concerned with constraints on different grammatical constructions and how they operate in terms of grammatical relations. A language is said to be syntactically ergative, if constructions such as coordination, relativisation or raising are sensitive to a S/P vs. A distinction; typically it will then treat the S/P argument preferentially and is then said to have an S/P or absolutive *pivot*. Syntactic ergativity is exhibited for example in Dyirbal:[^syntactic-erg]

[^syntactic-erg]: Example adapted from [12][#dixon94;].

<!--
\begin{example}\label{dyirbal-syntactic}
\glll 	ŋuma banaga-n\textsuperscript{y}u yabu-ŋgu buran
	father.ABS return-NONFUT mother-ERG see-NONFUT
	S {} A
\glt `Father returned and mother saw him.'
\glend
\end{example}
-->

What appears missing in example (<!--\ref{dyirbal-syntactic}-->) is a translational equivalent of the third person masculine pronoun 'him'. But there is no need to specify that argument in Dyirbal---since 'father' is S in the first and P in the second clause (that is, an absolutive argument) it doesn't have to be repeated. Contrast that with an English sentence like "Father returned and saw mother". In this sentence, "father" is implicitly understood to be the A argument (the subject) of the second clause, since English operates under a *nominative* pivot. It would not be possible to construct such a sentence in Dyirbal with the same meaning, much as example (<!--\ref{dyirbal-syntactic}-->) would not work in English.[^antipassive]

[^antipassive]: In English we can however build something similar by using a passive construction: "Father returned and was seen by mother". Much as the passive can be used to promote an object to subject (and therefore pivot) status, in languages with syntactic ergativity there is typically an antipassive construction that promotes ergative arguments to absolutive ones [146--152][#dixon94].

While in Dyirbal ergativity is manifest both in morphology (albeit with a split on the first and second person pronouns) and syntax, this seems to be rather rare: most morphologically ergative languages seem to work in terms of an S/A pivot. Some languages even have a mixed pivot, e.g. in Yidiny coordination operates sometimes in terms of S/A and sometimes of S/O, while relative clauses are sensitive to S/O [175--177][#dixon94].

But alignment patterns can be found in all kinds of grammatical constructions. [26][#donohue08;] notes for example that English past participles show split intransitive characteristics:

<!--
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item[A] *the eaten glutton
\item[SA] *the sung choir
\item[SP] the fallen leaves
\item[P] the beaten protesters
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
-->

One can easily see that a noun may only be modified by a past participle if it acts as an SP or P argument to the corresponding verb.

More generally, [#bickel10;] argues for what he calls the "construction-specific nature of grammatical relations". In that view, grammatical relations (and subsequently alignment systems) cannot be established with respect to a clause, but only with respect to particular constructions. As an example, he cites Nepali, where verbal affixes and case marking show different alignment types:
<!--
\begin{examples}
\item\label{nepali} Nepali \citep[??]{bickel10}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\gll ma ga-ẽ
     1SG.NOM go-1SG.PST
\glt `I went.'
\glend
\item
\gll mai-le timro ghar dekh-ẽ
     1SG-ERG your house.NOM see-1SG.PST
\glt `I saw your house.'
\glend
\end{enumerate}
\end{examples}
-->

Verbal marking in (<!--\ref{nepali}-->) is accusative; both S and A are cross-referenced by a suffix. On the other hand, case marking is clearly ergative, since only A, and not S, is marked by the suffix *-le*.

In order not to classify languages such as English as split intransitive, [??][#donohue08;] proposes to only consider *case marking*, *agreement* and *word order*. While I agree that this is usually what one talks about when assessing that a language *is* split intransitive, ergative and so on, the distinction seems arbitrary nonetheless and I see no principled reason why English participles, for instance, should not be analysed as an instance of split intransitivity, even if it is not as salient in the structure of the language as the more pronounced accusative system.

REWRITE FOLLOWING 2 SECTIONS. While Dyirbal and Latin both use case marking for the marking of arguments (and both have very flexible word order), ergativity or accusativity can show up in other kinds of marking as well; for example English has little morphology, but its accusative alignment can be seen (apart from the third person verbal agreement and pronominal case) by the fact that S and A generally come before the verb while P comes after in typical sentences. Conversely, as it has been claimed (citations?) that there exist no verb-medial ergative languages (or at least that they are very rare), and therefore that in ergative languages S, A and P will (almost) always appear on the same side of the verb, it will by consequence be uncommon for ergativity to be displayed by word-order [see also\]\[49--52][#dixon94]. Tolai and split intransitivity by word order (Dixon:76)?

It is not so easy to assess how frequent the different types are, especially as alignment can be dependant on the specific construction (see below). A rough estimate can be given by examining the distributions given in the *World Atlas of Linguistic Structure*, which, unfortunately, are split between pronominal, NP and verbal marking. Since many languages do not have one kind of marking or the other (e.g. many languages don't have any kind of (pro-)nominal case), it makes sense to calculate the ratio not only of an alignment type with respect to the whole sample, but also specifically with respect to the subsample that has any kind of such marking. [#wals-comrie,wals-siewierska]

|**Construction**  |**Nominative-accusative**|**Ergative-absolutive**|**Split intransitive**|**Unmarked**|
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------|
|*NP marking*      | 27% (52/190)            | 17% (32/190)          | 2% (4/190)           | ?? |
|*Pronoun marking* | 37% (64/172)            | 12% (20/172)          | 2% (3/172)           | ?? |
|*Verbal marking*  | 56% (212/380)           | 5% (19/380)           | 7% (26/380)          | ?? |
[Distribution of alignment types acording to WALS]

Of course, such a distributional analysis is flawed, primarily because the data samples (even if they are chosen to be well-balanced by themselves, something that is notoriously difficult in typology, given the sparsity of data [see\]\[??][#bickel07]) are not the same for the three construction types. Nonetheless we may tentatively conclude that ...

## A more empirical approach [rigour]
Typologists nowadays have become increasingly aware of the difficulty of finding a common ground (a *tertium comparationis*) for cross-linguistic comparison [see e.g. \]\[][#lazard02,cysouw07,bickel07,haspelmath07,haspelmath10a,itkonen10], although the notion that every language can only be described on its own terms had already been established by structuralism. Our definition of split intransitivity so far has been cast in the terms of the semantic primitives S, A and P, which are one such attempt at establishing a framework for language comparison. But these terms have not remained uncontroversial for a number of reasons. This section will attempt to provide a more solid theoretical foundation.

[#mithun99;] argue that S, A and P are inappropriate for the analysis of most languages. Their point is that the way in which participants are related to verbs can be very different across different languages. Accordingly, describing grammatical relations in these terms wouldn't do justice to the unique natures of individual languages. In particular, it can be argued that "split-S" languages encode semantic roles directly, not via the intermediate step of grammatical relations: agents are always marked as agents and patients as patients. A category like S with its two subtypes SA and SP would, so they argue, obscure the fundamental unity of SA and A or SP and P (for a similar argument see Van Valin? also: Dixon concedes that some languages have semantic marking?). As they observe, 

> speakers of [split-S languages] could say with equal justification that English is a 'split patient' language, since English sometimes marks patients as subjects, sometimes as objects" [578][#mithun99].

One might question the assumption that some languages encode agent and patient directly; idiosyncratic exceptions to split intransitive patterns in languages like Guaraní, as discussed before, where events are sometimes marked as SA, seem to indicate that this direct relationship may not be as straightforward as claimed. Also, the alternatives they propose---blah---don't seem all that compelling either, mainly due to a lack of precise definition. But that's not really at issue here, for these are hermeneutic considerations inquiring about the way individual languages can be understood to function, which are important in their own right (and to which maybe fields like psycholinguistics can offer more substantial input). If however typology is to be an empirical discipline---and I believe it is---in other words, if it aims to be the study of 'what's where when' [to quote\]\[][#bickel07], we need to seek concepts amenable to cross-linguistic comparison in an as straightforward and unambiguous manner as possible, in other words how to operationalise the concepts we are interested in studying into variables that are directly observable. There is no claim about some sort of psychological reality of these concepts here---in fact, I doubt that speakers of any language have a concept of S, A or P, or of many other typological variables, for that matters. I also subscribe, if maybe not as radically,[^haspelmath-disagree] to the view expressed in [#haspelmath07,haspelmath10a;] that descriptive and language-particular categories cannot be equated (? elaborate some). Precisely because there are so many incommensurable ways in which languages may encode the relationship between referents and events, these cannot be used as a framework for typological research but must remain confined to language-specific descriptions---which themselves do not have to rely on S, A and P necessarily. Instead of such language-specific categories, one has therefore to use a universally applicable set of notions in order to carry out cross-linguistic studies. Under this light, it doesn't matter whether S, A or P relate in any way to the internal workings of particular languages, as long as they are consistently defined. Whether they are good theoretical primitives can be determined *a posteriori*, considering whether their use has contributed significant insights.

[^haspelmath-disagree]: I think there are important, and systematic, relationships between descriptive and language-particular categories, but I agree that their ontological status is completely distinct.

But to be used as descriptive a prioris, S, A and P would have to be defined in a systematic and rigorous way. As it turns out, the theoretical status of the primitives in [#dixon94] is however often unclear. It seems at times that Dixon provides a definition based on observations in particular languages---while ideally descriptive categories should be independent (?? examples?) Furthermore, the primitives have been used in a number of very different and mutually incompatible ways by different scholars, as [#haspelmath11;] describes.

I am first going to define A and P in terms of a prototypical transitive construction. Following [#lazard02;],[^xyz] such a construction (which he calls the *major bi-actant construction*, or MBC) can be established on semantic grounds as the one used by a number of prototypical transitive verbs such as *hit*, *kill*, *break*. We can then identify the A role as the agent participant (the hitter, killer, etc.) and the P role as the patient (the affected entity, such as the one who is being hit, the killed, etc.). To say that a category such as S (which I will attempt to define shortly) "behaves" like A or P, is, therefore, equivalent to stating that it is encoded the same way as one of the participants of the MBC. Note that since it was established that alignment may be construction-specific, this means that S may behave like either A or P with respect to some properties, but not with respect to others.

[^xyz]: Lazard uses X, Y, Z, he also distinguishes blahblah.

Under this definition, A and P are fundamentally constructional (morphosyntactic) entities that, while initially identified via the semantics of prototypical transitive verbs, become then independent of the semantics of particular verbs. In other words, it doesn't matter how agentive or patientive an argument to a particular (non-prototypical) verb is, all that counts is the similarity of encoding to the agent or patient of the MBC. This definition contrasts with the one used e.g. by [#bickel10;]. In that kind of definition, A and P are newly established for each particular verb depending on the relative agentivity of the arguments, the more agentive-like being A, the more patientive-like being P. (example of differing prediction?) One could argue over the respective merits and drawbacks of each approach, and it is true [cfr.\]\[][#haspelmath11] that it may be much more difficult to define "agentivity" for non-prototypical verbs (such as stimulus-experiencer verbs; see Van Valin? for macro-roles); and, unlike Haspelmath, I don't want to argue a priori against the usage of Bickel's concepts, which may be relevant in domains such as lexical typology (cite study by Nichols). As long as it is rigorously defined and consistently applied, each approach will be as good as the results and insights it produces (and both may very well be valid)---for that reason it would be best if those very different concepts were expressed by different terminology, something that unfortunately isn't the case, adding a lot of confusion to any argument involving the primitives S, A and P (with many typologists not actually stopping to explain the theoretical status of the concepts they use in greater detail). Nevertheless, the approach based on Lazard and prototypical transitive verbs has a few benefits. For example, it accomodates the fact that transitivity may not be a binary category effortlessly. In many languages, there are constructions that are in some ways, but not totally similar to transitive constructions (cite Lazard and provide examples). Examples like the double patient construction in Lakhota or stimulus-experiencer verb would pose no problem for this definition, since A and P aren't relevant to these types of constructions and not defined in terms of them, and the same is true for ditransitive verbs or verbs with oblique objects. Haspelmath (where?) argues that while prototypical constructions are similar across languages, non-prototypical constructions can vary almost indefinitely; in other words, this approach tries to separate what stays the same from what's changing,[^prog-wis] the universal (it is hoped) communicative patterns (here, MBC) from the language-specific constructions (all kinds of constructions in any way related or opposed to the MBC). 

[^prog-wis]: To quote a piece of wisdom from the otherwise unrelated discipline of software engineering.

Unlike A and P, S proves a little more difficult to define with the same amount of rigour. The issue here is that we cannot really employ a semantic approach, given that a notion of "prototypical intransitivity" makes little sense when what we really want to establish is a split across different types of intransitive verbs. We are therefore limited to structural properties, and since we know that the structures of individual languages vary to an almost unpredictable extent, this poses a problem. I am nevertheless going to assume that we can identify in each language verbs that are structurally fully intransitive, i.e. take only a single argument.[^ambitransitives] This definition relies on the assumptions that first it is possible for each language to define what a "verb" is (as opposed to other predicates, such as adjectives), and second, that it is always clear to tell arguments from e.g. adjuncts. Both of these assumptions are problematic. While the argument-adjunct opposition did not pose complications for my analyses in the present thesis, the question of what constitues a verb (as opposed to other word classes) certainly was relevant, as Arawak SP verbs are generally translated by adjectives. I will not try to resolve this (important and non-trivial) issue here, but simply state that I considered a word class to be (sufficiently) "verbal" if it could be marked with the same set of affixes as transitive verbs could, in particular person markers (a heuristic that works quite well with head-marking languages). Nevertheless, this issue remains a gap in the theory of split intransitivity so far, and it is to be hoped that it will be taken up elsewhere.

[^ambitransitives]: There are of course certain verbs that may take one or two arguments, depending on the meaning, such as English 'break' (*The vase broke* vs. *I broke the vase*). These are sometimes called *ambitransitives* (Dixon?). It would be therefore more precise to identify intransitive verb *constructions*.

I also propose: *systematic* variance (in order to exclude occasional quirky cases as in "Mich friert").

With all the theoretical foundations in place, I can now proceed to a definition of split intransitivity which, I hope, is more useful for empirical research than previous ones:

<!--
\begin{description}
\item[1] A construction can be said to display split intransitive alignment if:
\begin{description}
\item[1.1] S arguments are treated sometimes like A and sometimes like P by this construction, where:
\begin{description}
\item[1.1.1] S is the single argument of an intransitive (monovalent) verb
\item[1.1.2] A and P are defined as the agent and patient of the MBC
\end{description}
\item[1.2] The assignment of an S argument to the A-like or the P-like class depends on the lexical semantics of the verb
\item[1.3] The classification is systematic and not confined to a few exceptional cases
\end{description}
\item[2] Different constructions in the same language may differ in whether they display split intransitivity or not.
\end{description}
